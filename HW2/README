This program displays baseball players' statistics.  The user interface is
an enumerated, alphabetical list of teams.  Typing the number of one brings
up an enumerated list of players, both first and last name in the event that
there would be duplicates of either (per Sam Bever, 10/22/14).  Selecting a
player brings up a list of the rest of their stats, prefaced with details
about what each number represents (per James Barnes 10/25/14).  From there,
if the user inputs the arbitrary "99", they will be returned to the team
menu.  There is no error checking with the user-interactions because we were
told to assume correct input (per David Augenblick, 10/24/14).  The strategy
of having a wholeTable array filled with teamLists filled with playerLists
came from sample code shown in class (per David Augenblick, 10/24/14), and
was expanded upon and curtailed as necessary to fit the assignment
requirements.  The program defaults to use the provided sample.in file, but
if another is provided as a command line argument, it will use that instead
(per James Barnes, 10/23/14).
