Q1: no output...the command searches for files modified in the last two
days, and there are none

Q2: find . -name "*.bash" -print

Q3: ./CS265/Lab1/hello.bash
    ./CS265/Lab1/play/CS265/Lab1/hello.bash
    ./tmp/gotMe.bash
my specific output is obviously unique because I have additional .bash files
in additional directories.  If you wanted to just find the .bash file in the 
new folder we just created, then I would change my answer to Q2 to
find ./tmp -name "*.bash" -print

Q4: 2538 characters, 421 words, 73 lines

Q5: grep "the" breadIsDangerous.txt | wc -l (produces 8 lines)

Q6: a wild spellExample.bak file has appeared!

Q7: the first number is the line in the first file that differs from the
line in the second file, and the letter between them tells you how to change 
the file to make them the same: a(dd), c(hange), or d(elete).  Then it lists 
the two lines so you can see the exact differences for yourself.

Q8: no output...the file is being compared to itself, so there are no
differences to display

Q9: echo $? displays the return value of the last executed command, so when
it successfully found "dough", it returned a 0 (true).  It couldn't find 
"uniqueString" so it returned 1 (false), and with "noSuchFile" it couldn't 
even find the file, so it returned 2 (still false, since everything other 
than 0 is)
