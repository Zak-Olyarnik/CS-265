Hello John,

I'm not certain why my name is on your message.  Perhaps I helped you in the past, but I 
don't remember that.  In any case, look at Corollary 11 on the pdf

www.math.rutgers.edu/~useminar/greek.pdf

I think it answers your question.  Namely, the construction of cube roots of whole 
numbers cannot be done with Euclidean tools.
