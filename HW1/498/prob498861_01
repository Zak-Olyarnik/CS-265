Hey Jenna, thanks for writing in,

In general, there would be no reason to change the first statement.
It's possible that you could be working with a language that doesn't
"officially" allow implication ('->'), but you would probably be aware
of that. For example, I studied a propositional calculus (called
PROPCAL) where the only two connectives we used were '->' and '~'.
This was adequate, as we could derive the other connectives from these
two - but these other connectives didn't officially exist within our
language (they just existed _metalinguistically_). So, if I had been
making a truth-table within PROPCAL, I would have "translated"
everything before starting, so that all my sentences were only in
terms of '->' and '~'. 

Does this make sense? Does it help?

If you are still stuck or you need help with any other problem then
feel free to write in again.
