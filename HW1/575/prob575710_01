Hi Hannah,

Well, how would you check something like

  12 / 4 = 3

after doing the division?  You'd do the corresponding multiplication, 

  12 = 4 * 3

and make sure it works, right?  The same thing here.  If you get

  3/4
 ----- = something
  7/8 

then it had better be true that 

  3/4 = 7/8 * something

Does that make sense?
