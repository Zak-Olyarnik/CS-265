First, what fraction of the gumballs are licorice? Divide the number 
of licorice gumballs by the total number of gumballs (divide 
the "part" by the "whole").

Then, to convert the fraction to a percentage, multiply it by 100%. 
(100% equals 1, so multiplying by 100% doesn't change the meaning, 
but it turns it into a percentage.)
