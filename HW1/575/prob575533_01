Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

1 gallon for every 25 miles is actually 25 miles to the gallon. I'm
not sure where you are getting 9 miles per gallon. The problem
statement gives you the fuel efficiency directly. The problem is to
figure out how many gallons of fuel were used in the city and on the
freeway.

Let's approach the problem analytically. We should list what we don't
know:

    x - # of gallons used in city driving
    y - # of gallons used in highway driving

We know that the total number of gallons used is 10, or:

    x + y = 10
        y = 10 - x

This is another way of saying that any gas not used in city driving is
used in highway driving.

The total number of miles driven in the city is:

   25x

since 25 miles are driven for every gallon used in the city. Likewise,
the total number of miles driven on the freeway is:

  40(10 - x)

We know the total number of miles driven is 360, or:

   25x + 40(10 - x) = 360

Solving this equation for x gives you the number of gallons used in
city driving.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
