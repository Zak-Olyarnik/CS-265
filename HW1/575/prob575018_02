We make use of the pigeonhole principle.

The difference between the two digits must be one of 0, 1, ..., 9

That is 10 possible differences.

The pigeonholes can be labelled 0 to 9.

We must now distribute 31 differences into these 10 holes.  The 
first 30 could be disatributed so that every hole had 3 pigeons but 
the 31st pigeon would have to go into a hole with 3 others.  So 
there would be 4 pigeons in one hole.  It follows that 4 numbers 
would have the same difference between its digits.
