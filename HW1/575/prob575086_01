Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

If y''' = e^x, then the indefinite integral of y''' is:

    y'' = e^x + a

where a is some constant.

The indefinite integral of y'' is given by:

    y' = e^x + ax + b

where b is yet another constant. I believe you see where this is going.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
