Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The answer is 28*35. To make this easier, consider a simpler situation:

   1 north-south street
   1 east-west street

There is 1 intersection and 1 stop light.

   2 north-south streets
   1 east-west street

There are 2 intersections and 2 lights (1*2 = 2).

   3 north-south streets
   2 east-west streets

There are 6 intersections (you can draw the picture) and 6 lights (3*2
= 6).

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
