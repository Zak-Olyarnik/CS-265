Usually when you want to put things in order, it helps to have them
all in the same sort of 'format', so to speak - all decimals, or all
fractions with the same denominator.  Then you can just look at the
numerators.  Does that make sense? 

I tend to like fractions better than decimals, here's what I'd do:

    2.75  ->  2 3/4   ->  2 12/16
    0.5   ->  0 1/2   ->  0  8/16
   22/8   ->  2 6/8   ->  2 12/16
   36/16  ->  2 4/16  ->  2  4/16

Now it would be easier to put them on a line, wouldn't it?  If you
like decimals better, you could convert everything to decimals:

    2.75  
    0.5   
   22/8   ->  2 6/8   ->  2 3/4  ->  2.75
   36/16  ->  2 4/16  ->  2 1/4  ->  2.25

And now it's easier to see where they all go.

Does this help?
