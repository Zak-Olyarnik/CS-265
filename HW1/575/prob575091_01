Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

I'll base my response on Q1 on your work:

>Q1  Find the probability of getting 2 or 3 tails when a coin is tossed
>four times.

>The answer is 5/8

>Q1 total outcomes are 16
>The prob of 2 tails is 6/16
>prob of 3 tails is 1/4
>therefore 2 or 3 tails is p 2T X p3T - prob of 2 " and 3 tails?
>so the answer works out to (6/16+1/4) - 6/64= 34/64, where as the
>correct answer is 5/8.

How can the result of 2 tails AND 3 tails. The two results are
mutually exclusive. Either exactly 2 tails were flipped OR 3 tails
were flipped. So, the probabilities are added:

    6/16 + 1/4 = 10/16 = 5/8

The team cannot lose. So, it can only win or tie. The team must win at
least two of its games. The possible outcomes are:

    Win, Win, Tie
    Win, Tie, Win
    Tie, Win, Win
    Win, Win, Win

The first three have a probability of (0.7)(0.7)(0.1). The last
possibility has a probability of (0.7)(0.7)(0.7). 

   3*(0.7)(0.7)(0.1) + (0.7)(0.7)(0.7) = 0.49

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
