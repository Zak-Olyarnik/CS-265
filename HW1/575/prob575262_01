Hi Greg,

They don't have a value; they're place holders for values that we
_might_ want to give them.  For example, 

  6xy
  ---
  16y

means 

  (6 times x times y) divided by (16 times y)

If we assign x and y the values x=1 and y=2, the expression has a
particular value:

   6*1*2   12
   ----- = --
   16*1    32

If we assign x and y the values x=5 and y=4, the expression has a
different value:

  6*5*4   30
  ----- = --
  16*4    16

If you try other values for x and y, you'll find that the value of the
expression doesn't depend on y at all.  Do you see why this is the case?
