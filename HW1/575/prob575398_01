Hi Chris,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It looks like you get the next element
of C by

  add 5, add 6, add 7, etc.

so you might assume that this pattern continues.  Certainly there are
various ways to generate a sequence that starts with those terms, but
a nice check would be that it contains the number 229.  And, indeed,

  229 = 8 + (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + ... + 21).

Can you write a quadratic polynomial in x that equals

  8 + (5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + ... + (x-3) ) ?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
