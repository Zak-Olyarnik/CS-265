It's hard to be sure what you are asking. Are you asking what each 
term means?

An equation is a number sentence that says that two expressions have 
the same value. It always contains an equal sign, for instance

  2x - 3 = 5(4+x)

An inequality is a number sentence that compares two expressions 
using something other than equality. If you replace the equal sign in 
an equation with > (greater than), < (less than), or symbols that I 
can't show you exactly, meaning "greater than or equal", "less than 
or equal", or "not equal to", you'll have an inequality. For instance,

  2x - 3 < 5(4+x)

A quadratic equation is one that can be put into the form

  __x^2 + __x + __ = 0

where x is the variable (it doesn't have to be x) and numbers go in 
the three blanks. For example,

  8z^2 - z + 2 = 0

Here, the numbers that go in the blanks are 8, -1, and 2.

A quadratic equation is a type of polynomial equation. A polynomial 
equation can have more terms (parts that are added together to make 
the whole expression; there are three terms in the quadratic). Each 
term is a number times a whole-number power of the variable. For 
instance,

  3y^4 - y^3 + 8y^2 + 10 = 0

A rational equation is an equation involving rational expressions. A 
rational expression is a polynomial divided by another polynomial. 
For example,

  (1/x+1) - (1/x+2) = 1/2

If you want to understand something particular about these types of 
equations and inequalities, I will try to help.
