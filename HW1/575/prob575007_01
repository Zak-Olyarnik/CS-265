Hi Kendal,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You are correct.  A function f(x)
has a vertical asymptote at x=a if one of the limits

  lim f(x)   or   lim  f(x)
 x->a-           x->a+


is infinite (-oo or +oo).

If f(x) is a fraction g(x)/h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are continuous
functions, and if h(a) = 0 while g(a) is not 0, then f will have a
vertical asymptote at x=a.

I think one of the points of this problem is that the denominator of
a fraction can approach 0 without the function having a vertical
asymptote (as for this function, at x=1), because the numerator also
approaches 0.  In this case, the two zeros cancel each other.  In
other cases, they may not cancel, and the function might indeed have
a vertical asymptote.  It takes more work to determine whether the
function does indeed have a vertical asymptote.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
