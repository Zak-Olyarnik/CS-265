Hello, Raghav --

Having the sum of the digits equal to 3 limits us to a very few 
possibilities.  Along with any number of 0's, we can have either

(1) one 3
(2) one 2 and one 1
(3) three 1's

Let's find all the numbers less than 200 for each of these cases:

(1)  3, 30
(2)  12, 21, 102, 120
(3)  111

So all the numbers less than 200 for which the sum of the digits is 
3 are

  3, 12, 21, 30, 102, 111, 120

Your problem says the number is divisible by 6; several of these 
numbers satisfy that condition:

  12, 30, 102, 120

We have used both of the conditions given for the number, so any one 
of these could be an answer to the problem.

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
