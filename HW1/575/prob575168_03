Hi Janell,

Thanks for writing back.  It was a pretty good guess, but it's
probably  better to know that you can always answer the question

  How many ___'s are in ____?

by using division.  For example, how many 25's are in 100? 

         4
     _____
  25 ) 100

Note that this is the same question as "How many quarters are in a
dollar?"  So to answer "How many thousands are in 800,000?", we can
divide:

            800
       ________
  1000 ) 800000
         8000
         ----
            000

Also, it helps to know that "800,000" is pronounced "800 thousand",
which means, literally, "800 groups of 1000".  That sort of gives the
answer away right there, doesn't it?  :^D
