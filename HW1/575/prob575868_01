Hi Dan,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  To prove that

   lim f(x) = L
  x->a

you must show that given any positive epsilon (E), there is a 
positive delta (d) such that if 0 < |x-a| < d, then |f(x) - L| < E.

One way that often works is to find what is called a "Lipschitz
inequality", which says that there is a constant C and a number d1
such that for 0 < |x-a| < d1, 

   |f(x) - L| <= C|x-a| .

If you have a Lipschitz inequality for f, can you see how to find
d, given E?

For f(x) = 1/x,
                      |x-a| 
   |(1/x) - (1/a)| = -------   .
                       |ax|

The quantity |x-a| is multiplied by the factor 1/|ax|. When x is
close to a, how big can this factor be?  If you can find an upper
bound C, then you will have a Lipschitz inequality for f at x=a.

A fraction (such as 1/|ax|) gets larger as you decrease its 
denominator, and if the denominator can approach 0, the fraction
will become unbounded.  How can you make sure that the denominator
stays away from 0?  (You get to restrict x to an interval |x-a| < d1;
how would you choose d1?)  If you make a restriction which keeps
x away from 0, how large can 1/|ax| be? 

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
