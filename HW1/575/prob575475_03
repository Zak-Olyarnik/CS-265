Hi Rah,

The question was:

  2. A bar graph shows weights in kilograms for a group of 
     althletes.  Show the same information on a circle graph 
     and on a line plot.  Label each wedge of the graph with 
     the appropriate percent.

Suppose the bar graph looks like this:

     31 -50 kg   **
     51- 80 kg   ****
     81-110 kg   ********
    111-141 kg   **

If we compare the quantities, we see that the third group has half the
athletes in it; the second group has one-fourth the athletes in it;
and the first and fourth groups have one-eight of the athletes in each
one. 

So an equivalent chart would look like

     31 -50 kg   1/8
     51- 80 kg   1/4
     81-110 kg   1/2
    111-141 kg   1/8

If we convert the fractions to percentages, it would look like

     31 -50 kg   12.5%
     51- 80 kg   25%
     81-110 kg   50%
    111-141 kg   12.5%

Note that all the fractions have to add up to 1, and all the
percentages have to add up to 100. 

Now, let's say I draw a circle:

            .
       .         .


     .             .


       .         .
            .


and I cut the circle into pieces, where each piece represents one of
the fractions:

           [3]
            .                   Part [1] is 1/8 of the circle
       .         .              Part [2] is 1/4 of the circle
                                Part [3] is 1/2 of the circle
                                Part [4] is 1/8 of the circle
     ...............
            .
  [1]    .  .
       .    .    .
            .     [2]
       [4]


So this is just a different way of showing the same information. Some
people prefer percentages to fractions, so I can label them with
percentages:

           [3]
            .                   Part [1] is 12.5% of the circle
       .         .              Part [2] is 25%   of the circle
                                Part [3] is 50%   of the circle
                                Part [4] is 12.5% of the circle
     ...............
            .
  [1]    .  .
       .    .    .
            .     [2]
       [4]

Does this make sense?
