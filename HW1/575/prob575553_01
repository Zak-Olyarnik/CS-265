Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Mathematics doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you see the word "isolate"
in a math problem, it generally means you should isolate the variable
(or expression). In math, we use the language that is available. If
there is a need for a specific term, it is usually clearly defined
before being used. Otherwise, you can assume the standard English
definition applies.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
