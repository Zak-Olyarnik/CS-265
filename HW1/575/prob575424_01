Hi Jason,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Think about it like this:

  When is a/b positive?

To answer that question, answer this one:  What is the sign of a/b if

  a is positive and b is positive,
  a is positive and b is negative,
  a is negative and b is positive,
  a is negative and b is negative.

Now suppose that Q is positive.  What does that tell you about the
numerator and the denominator?  How can you tell when the numerator or
denominator are positive/negative?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
