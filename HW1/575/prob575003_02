There was a mistake in my answer to the second question.  I should 
have given Larry 4 choices before then allocating the remaining 3.  
I have given the complete solution again below.

>(1) Find the probability that both males and females are given a 
task

The total number of ways of distributing the tasks is

 P(13,4) = 17160

The number of ways that only men are given tasks = P(6,4)

     "                   "  women      "     "   = P(7,4)

The number of ways with both men and women 

                            = P(13,4) - P(6,4) - P(7,4)

                        P(13,4) - P(6,4) - P(7,4)
Required probability = ---------------------------
                               P(13,4)

                         15960       133
                     =  -------  =  -----
                         17160       143


>(2) Find the probability that Larry and at least one female are 
>given tasks.

We give tasks to Larry plus 1 or 2 or 3 women.

Larry plus 1 woman =  4 x P(5,2) x P(7,1)   =   560
Larry plus 2 women =  4 x P(5,1) x P(7,2)   =   840
Larry plus 3 women =  4 x P(7,3)            =   840
                                            ----------
                                      Total =  2240

                           2240       56 
  Required probability = -------  =  ----
                          17160      429
