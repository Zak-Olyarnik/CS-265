Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

By Fermat's little theorem, for a prime p and a natural number a:

     a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p)

Or:

     a^22 = 1 (mod 23)

2002 = 91*22 -> 44^2004 = 44^2 (mod 23)

So, 44^2004 leaves the same remainder as 44^2 when divided by 23. Also
note that 44 = -2 (mod 23), or 44 leaves a remainder of 21 (equivalent
to -2) when divided by 23. (-2)^2 = 4, which means that 44^2 leaves a
remainder of 4 when divided by 23, or 44^2004 leaves a remainder of 4
when divided by 23.

Now, we must show that 27^499 * 19^503 leaves a remainder of 19 when
divided by 23 to show that the entire expression is divisible by 23.
Using the same trick as above:

   27^499 = 27^15 (mod 23)
   19^503 = 19^19 (mod 23)

You use similar tricks as above to simplify these expressions to show
that their product is equivalent to 19 (mod 23).

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
