Hi,

Could you state the problem you are trying to solve? So far, you
haven't given the instructions for your problem, the work you have
done so far, or the problems you are having in finding a solution. In
your subject line, you give an expression only. Presumably, your
problem involves this expression.

So, if you could please explain what you are trying to do, we could help.
