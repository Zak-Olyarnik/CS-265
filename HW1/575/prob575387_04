Hi Meital,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  That's the right idea, except that writing

  0modm + amodn + bmodm+ 0modn

is not at all clear and might even imply a misunderstanding about
modular arithmetic.  You should have one equation mod n and another
equation mod m, as in

  at + by = a + 0 (mod n)
  at + by = 0 + b (mod m).

Other than that, that's exactly what you want to do.
