Hi Marco,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Let's say you have four pegs, and four
rings.  So you start with

  1
  2
  3
  4  .  .  .

and then you move like this:


  2
  3
  4  1  .  .


  3
  4  1  2  .


  4  1  2  3


        1
  4  .  2  3


        1
  .  4  2  3


     3  1
  .  4  2  .


     3
  .  4  2  1


     2
     3
  .  4  .  1


     1
     2
     3
  .  4  .  .

And I've done it in nine moves.  Can you do four rings in nine moves
if you only have three pegs?

I didn't think so.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
