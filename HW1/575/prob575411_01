Hello Kelly,

Are you painting?  What about the ceiling?

If the floor is a rectangle, say 12ft by 10 ft, and the height of the walls (from floor to 
ceiling) is 8 ft, then

1. you have two walls that are 12 ft by 8 ft
2. you have two walls that are 10 ft by 8 ft
3. you have one ceiling that is 12 ft by 10 ft

So, you would multiply 12 by 8 and then double this; multiply 10 by 8 and double this; 
and then multiply 12 by 10.  After all of that, just add up the results:

12*8 = 96 and 2*96 = 192
10*8 = 80 and 2*80 = 160
12*10 = 120


192 + 160 + 120 = 472 square feet.
