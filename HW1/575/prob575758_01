The page to which you refer is this one:

  Googolplex: Sheets of Paper 
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/59174.html

There is a confusion in the question there, which accounts for the 
confusion you find. The question was, "Can you tell me how many 
sheets of paper it will take to make a googolplex if you can have 
20,000 zeros on each page?" What does "make a googolplex" mean? I 
think the writer wanted to write the *decimal form* of a googolplex 
(which is a 1 followed by a googol zeros). This is the question Dr. 
Rob answered. However, it appears that Dr. Mark took the question to 
mean, "How many pages would it take to write a googolplex *zeros*?" 
This is the question he answered, along the way also answering the 
question of how many pages it would take to write a googol zeros 
(essentially the same as the first interpretation of the question).

I can ask our Archivist to add a note to the page regarding this 
difference in interpretation, if you'd like.
