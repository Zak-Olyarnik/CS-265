Hi Sheila,

The first thing to do is make sure you understand what a variable is,
and what it means to use a variable in an expression or equation. 
Take a look at 

  Variables, Explained
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62905.html

and let me know if it's not clear, or if there's anything in it you
don't understand.  Then we can talk about how to translate sentences
into expressions, okay?
