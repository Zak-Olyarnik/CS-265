>Hi, Nick --

If I understand it correctly, this certainly is a difficult problem 
to solve.  In fact, the way you have presented it, I don't believe 
it can be solved....

I think you have left out some critical information.  The problem 
can be solved -- and the answer comes out "nice" -- if you state 
that person B reaches place Q at the same time as person A.

So person A is covering the number of miles "x" between places P and 
Q in 14 hours, and person B is covering "x+10" miles in the same 14 
hours.

I looked for quite a while for ways to combine pieces of information 
in this problem to cut down on the number of steps and the amount of 
work required, but I couldn't find any.  So the solution below takes 
one slow step at a time through the entire problem.

(1) The thing we need to find is the distance between P and Q, so we 
might as well make that our unknown:

  let x = distance (miles) between P and Q

(2) We know A covers the distance x in 14 hours, so

  speed of A = x/14 (miles per hour)

(3) A's speed is x/14 miles per hour; we can view this as 14/x hours 
per mile, so then

  A's time to go 20 miles = 20*(14/x) = 280/x (hours)

(4) We are told that B covers 20 miles in 1/2 hour less than A, so

  B's time to go 20 miles = 280/x - 1/2 (hours)

(5) Since it takes B (280/x - 1/2) hours to go 20 miles, we know

                   20
  B's speed = -----------
              280/x - 1/2

                   20
            = ------------
                 560-x
                 -----
                   2x

               40x
            = -----  (miles per hour)
              560-x

(6) We now have expressions for B's speed and for the distance he 
covers; the time required for that (distance divided by speed) must 
be 14 hours:

      x+10
  ----------- = 14
      40x
     -----
     560-x


  (x+10)(560-x)
  ------------- = 14
       40x

  (x+10)(560-x) = 560x

  -x^2+550x+5600 = 560x

  -x^2-10x+5600 = 0

  x^2+10x-5600 = 0

  (x+80)(x-70) = 0

  x = -80 or x = 70

Clearly x = -80 does not make sense for this problem; the distance 
between places P and Q is 70 miles.

I hope all this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
