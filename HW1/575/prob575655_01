Hi Nadine,

Choosing intervals is more an art than a science, and the optimal
intervals depend on the way the values in a data set are distributed:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57612.html

The authors of the book may have some reasons for choosing to break
the diagram into four intervals; other authors might choose other
intervals.  There's no one-size-fits-all formula for doing it.  

Does this help?
