Hi Lynn,

Yes, that is a "piecewise" function, since it is defined in "pieces",
that is, given different formulas on different intervals.  Remember 
that the definition of a function f being continuous at x=a is that

   lim f(x) = f(a)  .
  x->a

From general theorems that say the the sum of functions continuous at
a point is continuous at that point, and similarly for the product, we
can say that polynomials are continuous everywhere.  If two functions
are equal in an open interval, say f(x) = g(x) in (a,b), and if g is
continuous at every point in (a,b), then so is f.

In the example above, on the interior of each interval [i.e. on
(-oo,1),(1,2),(2,3), and (3,oo)], f is equal to a polynomial and so
it is continuous in each open interval.  That leaves only the endpoints
of the intervals, where the function changes formulas, to consider.

When a function is defined piecewise, with different formulas on each
side of a point, to determine if the limit exists at the point 

   lim f(x)  ,
  x->a 

you examine the two one-sided limits

   lim f(x)    and  lim f(x)
  x->a-            x->a+

and determine if they exist, and if so, whether they are equal.  The
ordinary ("two-sided") limit exists if and only if both one-sided 
limits exist and are equal.  Then you can use the definition of
continuity to determine whether f is continuous at each transition
point.
