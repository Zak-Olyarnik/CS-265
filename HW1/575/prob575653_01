Hi kang,

I think the following answer from the Dr. Math archive will tell 
you what you want to know: 

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52135.html

along with

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Erf.html .

I found it by searching on these keywords:

  e^(x^2) antiderivative

You can find other similar answers by doing the same search at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
