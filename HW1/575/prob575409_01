Hi Jaydeep,

You can compute percentages of negative numbers.  You just get
negative values as a result, e.g., 

   800% of -50 = -400

What interpretation you place on this is up to you.  It might mean a
loss instead of a profit, or a reduction instead of a growth.  

But you can't really decide what to do without taking into account
what the 'rule' is supposed to accomplish.  If it's just supposed to
act as some kind of filter on high values, then you could just compare
x to the negative percentage.  If x is positive, it will _always_
satisfy the condition.  That might be fine. 

On the other hand, if it's supposed to act as some kind of filter on
large swings in either direction, you'd probably want to compare
absolute values, e.g., 

   if |x| > |800% of y|

Here, the || means 'compute the value, but ignore the sign'.  Here are
some examples:

   x   y     x > 800% of y?      |x| > |800% of y|
  --- ---    --------------      -----------------
   10  1         yes                  yes
    7  1         no                   no
   -7  1         no                   no
  -10  1         no                   yes

   10 -1         yes                  yes
    7 -1         yes                  no
   -7 -1         yes                  no
  -10 -1         no                   yes

As I said, either of these interpretations might be correct, depending
on what your goal is.  Two other possible interpretations would be

   if x > |800% of y|

or

  if |x| > 800% of y 

Does this help?
