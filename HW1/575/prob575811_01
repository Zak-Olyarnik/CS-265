Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

There is no advantage, in a lottery, to buying multiple tickets in a
single week versus buying a single number set for successive drawings.
The appropriate analogy is flipping a single coin 10 times versus
flipping 10 coins once. 

You expect the same statistical behavior in both cases. The difference
comes in variance. Buying multiple lottery tickets a single time means
that for every drawing, you have signficant variance. You can lose or
win bigger than by drawing a single ticket. So, the _average_ value
you lose (since there is no strategy that makes the lottery a winner)
is the same in both cases, the fluctuations up and down in how much
you win or lose are much greater by buying several tickets at a time
versus 1 at a time for a longer period of time. 

In fact, because the chance of winning the lottery is so slim, you
probably want to reduce your variance. In other words, considering
factors that are not statistical, you may want to spend $1 a day over
the next 100 days versus risking $100 on today's drawing and waiting
100 days to play the lottery again. The _average_ value of your gamble
is the same, but the variance can have effects outside the lottery
(i.e. on your disposable income).

The electrical storm argument fails because a single event never lasts
that long. If you had an electrical storm that lasted for days, then
the analogy might hold up. Basically, you can't compare standing
outside for a protracted time during a single electrical storm to
briefly standing outside during several storms, since a single storm
doesn't ever last that long. So, yes, a person who steps outside
during every storm is more likely to be struck. But that person is
exposing themselves for a longer period of time than riding out a
single storm. The coin analogy is apt here.
