Hi Jessica,

Sometimes, when a problem description is confusing, you can get a
better grasp of the problem by trying out some values.  For example,
suppose we just make a wild guess:  Alex swam 20 feet, and Fran swam
50 feet.  Could this be possible?  Let's check it against the problem
statement:

   1) Fran swam 10 feet farther than Alex.

Right away, we have a problem!  50 isn't 10 more than 20.  Once we
pick a value for Alex's distance, we don't get to choose Fran's
distance:  We just add 10 to Alex's distance.  So let's try another
guess, using our improved strategy:  Alex swam 20 feet, and Fran swam
20+10, or 30 feet.  Again, let's check the problem statment:

   1) Fran swam 10 feet farther than Alex.
   2) Together, they swam 54 feet.

The first condition is okay: 30 is 10 more than 20.  But when we add
them, we get 20+30 = 50, when we wanted to get 54.  

So we're in the ballpark, but we need a little fine-tuning.  

Can you take it from here?
