Hi Russell,
your method makes sense to me!
I might have done it a bit differently, without subtracting the two
leading digits first:
2 is the 3rd, 6th, 9th, ... decimal digit (remainder 0)
7 is the 4th, 7th, 10th, ... decimal digit (remainder 1)
0 is the 5th, 8th, 11th, ... decimal digit (remainder 2).
Since 121/3 is remainder 1, my answer is also 7.

Your answer is pretty much the same as mine: you wanted to
start counting with 1, so you subtracted the 2 digits from the 121,
while I added the 2 digits to the starting point (so that 2 is the 3rd
digit instead of the 1st).

Very nice work you did, and a very clear explanation, too!

Thanks,
