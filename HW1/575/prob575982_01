Hi Katherine,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Your steps so far are correct; you
just need to keep going.  The next thing to do is to rationalize the
numerator, i.e. multiply the numerator and denominator by

   Sqrt(3-a) + sqrt(3-(a+h)

(you can factor out the coefficient 2 in the numerator first, to 
simplify slightly).  This will greatly simplify the numerator,
and although the denominator will have a lot of terms, it will make 
it possible to take the limit as h->0 .

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
