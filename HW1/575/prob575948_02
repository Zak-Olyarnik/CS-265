Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

A function is just a mapping from one set to another. 

For example:

   X = {1, 2, 3}
   Y = {a, b}

   f: X -> Y

   f(1) = a
   f(2) = b
   f(3) = b

f is one of the possible functions from X to Y. In this case, |X| = 3
and |Y| = 2. The |.| notation stands for "cardinality", which, for
finite sets, represents how many elements are in the set. 

The problem before you is to figure out how many ways you can assign
values in Y to elements of X. For instance, in the example above, |X|
= 3 and |Y| = 2. We just listed one possible mapping. Here's another:

   g: X -> Y
   g(1) = b
   g(2) = a
   g(3) = a

This is another function from X to Y. So, we know there are at least 2
functions from X to Y. 

Your problem is to figure out the total number of such functions if
|X| = m and |Y| = n. 

Here's a start. If |Y| = 1, or n = 1, then the number of such
functions is 1 (everything in X gets mapped to the only element in Y).
If |X| = 1, or m = 1, then the number of such functions is n (the one
element in X could be mapped to any of the n elements of Y. Try a
slightly more advanced example where m = 2 and n = 2, and then where m
= 3 and n = 2. See if you can find the pattern.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
