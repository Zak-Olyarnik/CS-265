Hi Levana,

>what are the different kinds of fractions? explain each

Probably your teacher is talking about 'proper' and 'improper'
fractions.  The difference is that in a proper fraction, the numerator
is smaller than the denominator.  Here are some proper fractions, 

  1  3  12
  -, -, --
  2  7  19

Here are some improper fractions:

  3  9  24
  -, -, --
  2  7  19

Do you see the difference?
