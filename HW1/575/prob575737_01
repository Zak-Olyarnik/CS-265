Hello, James --

You don't say how you came up with your initial guess of 3 and 5 
camels... but you are on the right track there.  If the numbers of 
camels are to be equal after the second raja gives one camel to the 
first, then the second raja must start out with two camels more than 
the first.

With your guess of 3 and 5, the other part of the problem does not 
work out.  But you simply need to try other pairs of starting 
numbers which differ by 2 and see which one works:

  3 and 5  ==>  2 and 6  no...
  4 and 6  ==>  3 and 7  no...
  5 and 7  ==>  4 and 8  yes...!

The first raja starts out with 5 camels and the second starts out 
with 7.

This problem is relatively easily solved using the guess-and-check 
method above.  We can also solve it using formal algebra.

  let x = first raja's number of camels
      y = second raja's number of camels

Then

(1) "If [second raja] gives [first raja] one camel then we will have 
an equal number of camels"

Read this in terms of numbers of camels:  The second raja loses 1 
camel and the first raja gains 1 camel and the resulting numbers are 
equal -- one less than the second raja starts out with is equal to 
one more than the first raja starts out with:

  y-1 = x+1

(2) "...if [first raja] gives [second raja] one camel then [second 
raja] will have double the number [first raja] has"

Again read this in terms of numbers of camels:  The second raja 
gains one camel and the first raja loses one camel, and the second 
raja ends up with twice as many as the first -- one more than the 
second raja starts out with equals twice as much as one less than 
the first raja starts out with:

  y+1 = 2(x-1)

So we have

  y-1 = x+1
  y+1 = 2(x-1)

We can solve this pair of equations by any of several methods; below 
I choose to solve the first equation for "y" and substitute in the 
second equation:

  y-1 = x+1
  y = x+2
  (x+2)+1 = 2(x-1)
  x+3 = 2x-2
  5 = x
  y = x+2 = 5+2 = 7

  x (first raja) = 5 camels
  y (second raja) = 7 camels

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
