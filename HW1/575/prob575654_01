Before complicating things with divisions, I would first simplify
everything by eliminating the parentheses. For example, on the left
side you can multiply through by b, and on the right by a. Then step
back and look at it as if a, b, c, and p were just numbers. (If you
want, actually replace them with numbers for the moment, just to make
it clearer.) You will see something like

  _x + _ = _x + _

You've probably solved these before; just gather the variable terms on
one side and the constant terms on the other.

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
