Hi, Monica --

I like the following 4-step process for solving word problems:

1) define the variables and expressions we are going to use
2) write on equation
3) solve the equation
4) find the answer to the problem

The first step is very important.  In high school classroom and in 
the "math doctoring" I do here on the internet, I am constantly 
helping students who get lost on a problem because they try to write 
an equation without first carefully defining the variables and 
expressions in that equation.

Let's look in detail at the steps for this example problem.  Note 
that -- as is almost always the case -- the specific details of the 
solution we show are not necessary; another person might follow a 
different but also perfectly valid path to the final solution.

1) define variables and expressions

We want to use as few variables as possible; more variables means a 
more complex problem.  The things we need to find are (a) the number 
of quarters, (b) the number of dimes, and (c) the number of 
nickels.  We would like, if possible, to find expressions for these 
three unknown quantities which use only one variable.

In this problem we can do this, because (a) the number of dimes is 
defined in terms of the number of quarters ("she has twice as many 
dimes as quarters") and (b) the number of nickels is defined in 
terms of the number of dimes ("she has ... and five more nickels 
than dimes").  So we can define the three unknowns using a single 
variable, as follows:

  q = number of quarters
  2q = number of dimes  [twice as many dimes as quarters]
  2q+5 = number of nickels  [five more nickels than dimes]

2) write an equation

The problem tells us the total amount of money we have; using the 
variables and expressions we have defined and what we know about the 
value of each type of coin, we can write an equation for the total 
amount of money.  Note it will be easier if we work with cents than 
with dollars; working with cents will allow us to work with whole 
numbers, whereas working with dollars would make us work with 
fractions.

So we need to write an equation which says

  number of quarters, at 25 cents each; plus
  number of dimes, at 10 cents each; plus
  number of nickels, at 5 cents each
  equals 300 cents ($3.00)

The algebraic equivalent of the above statement in words is

  (q)(25) + (2q)(10) + (2q+5)(5) = 300

3) solve the equation

This is basic algebra....

  (q)(25) + (2q)(10) + (2q+5)(5) = 300
  25q + 20q + 10q + 25 = 300
  55q = 275
  q = 5

4) find the answer to the problem

"q=5" is not the answer to the problem.  The answer to the problem 
is the numbers of quarters, dimes, and nickels.  We have

  number of quarters = q = 5
  number of dimes = 2q = 10
  number of nickels = 2q+5 = 15

The answer to the problem is

  5 quarters, 10 dimes, and 15 nickels

A good step 5) in the problem-solving process is "check your 
answer".  It is easy to make simple arithmetic or logic errors and 
get the wrong answer, even though your method was sound.  So let's 
check our answer....

5) check answer

  5 quarters = $1.25
  10 dimes   =  1.00
  15 nickels =   .75
  ------------------
       total =  3.00

I hope all this helps.  Always use this 4-step (or 5-step) approach 
to problem solving and you will have a mcuh better chance of success.
