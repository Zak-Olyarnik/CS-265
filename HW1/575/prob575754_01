Hi Mackey,

You and everyone else!  I've heard that Richard Feynman, after decades
of practice, was able to visualize 4-dimensional constructs; but
there's no way to know whether that's true or not; and if it was true,
there's no way to know how he did it. 

The best most people can do is use analogy, i.e., to think about how 4
dimensions would look to us by thinking about how 3 dimensions would
look to someone who lives in 2 dimensions.  A good start in that
direction would be to read the book _Flatland_, by E.A. Abbott.  You
can find the complete book online here:
