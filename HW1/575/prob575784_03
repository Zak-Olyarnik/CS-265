Hi Christina,

In that context, I would say that you 'multiply or divide by powers of
10', but I think in this context it would also be correct to just say
'multiply', i.e., to interpret 10^-3 as a 'power of 10'. 

But in the end, it's not really a precise term, and you can be correct
but still be misunderstood by others.  (Compare it to how, in lots of
political conversations, two people can be talking about 'freedom' or
'rights', and yet mean completely different things by those words.)

After all, the square root of 10 is 10^(1/2).  So can we call that a
'power of 10'?  Normally we'd call it a 'rational power'.  So instead
of just using 'power of 10', it would probably be a good idea to
always use one of the following:

  non-negative integer powers of 10:  10^0, 10^1, 10^2, ...

  integer powers of 10: 10^0, 10^(+/-1), 10^(+/-2), ...

  rational powers of 10:  10^(a/b), where a and b are integers

Does this help?
