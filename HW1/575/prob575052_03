The mistake is to say that YOU are more likely to be involved in an 
accident when sober than when drunk.  For any individual the 
opposite is true.  If the number of drunk drivers is say 10 in a 100 
then 10% of drivers are contributing 30% of the accidents.  If the 
total number of accidents is say 100 this means each drunk driver is 
involved in 3 accidents.  On the other hand, 90 sober drivers are 
involved in 70 accidents so each sober driver is involved in 7/9 
accidents, that is less than 1 accident per driver.  It follows that 
each sober driver is LESS likely to be involved in an accident.
