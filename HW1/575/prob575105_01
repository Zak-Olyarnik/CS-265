>(44/2 = 22)/2 = 11
>(44/11 = 4)/2 = 2

We have a number of more recent discussions of this question, which go
into more detail. Here are a couple:

  Simplifying Expressions with Radicals
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52641.html

  Dividing Radicals
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52646.html

In your example,

  sqrt(44) = sqrt(4*11) = sqrt(4) * sqrt(11) = 2 * sqrt(11)

We have factored out a square, so that when we take the root, that
factor will just give a whole number.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back. I can give
more specific help if you point out a point in the process where you
are unsure.
