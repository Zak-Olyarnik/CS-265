It helps to choose a variable and define it carefully. You have three
integers to find, but if you know one of them you can find all. We
could choose any of them as your unknown. In many cases with three
consecutive integers, it is easiest to use the _middle_ one as the
unknown, so I'll do that:

  x = middle number of the three

Then what are the other numbers? They are x-1 and x+1, the integers
before and after x. So our three numbers are

  smallest: x-1
  middle:   x
  largest:  x+1

Now, what are we told about them? See if you can translate what you
are told into one equation. It will help if you take it one piece at a
time, first finding expressions for each of the following phrases, and
then putting them together into a "sentence":

  the sum of the smallest and 3 times the largest
  2 less than 3 times the middle integer

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
