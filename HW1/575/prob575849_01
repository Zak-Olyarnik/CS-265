Hi Harding,

The point here is that if you're told that 

   a + b = 5

then you can express either a or b in terms of the other.  That is, if 

   a + b = 5

then 

       a = 5 - b

and

       b = 5 - a

Try this with some values, to convince yourself that it's true.  (If I
tell you that b is 2, you know that a is 5 - 2, or 3, right?)

So, if b = 5 - a, then wherever we see 'b', we can replace it with
'(5-a)'.  For example, we see it in 

    b - a = ?

So let's replace it:

    (5 - a) - a = ?

We can simplify this, to get

   5 - 2a = ?

and this is what we're looking for.  What we're _not_ looking for is a
particular numeric value, because as you noted, there isn't a unique
pair of values for a and b that satisfy the equation.  There are
infinitely many pairs of values.  

But do you see why if the first condition is true, then 

  b - a = 5 - 2a

must also be true?
