Although any positive number has two square roots, when we use the
radical symbol, we want it to stand for just one number, so that we
can tell what number someone has in mind when he writes an expression.
(That is, we want it to be a "function", a way to get one number when
you are given a specific number.) We naturally take it to be the
positive root, since we are usually looking for a positive answer
(e.g. when we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of a
line). If we want to talk about the negative root, then we just put a
negative sign before the radical; and if we want to specific _both_
roots, we use the plus-or-minus sign to say that explicitly. This way
we can say whatever we want to say, which makes the symbol more useful
than if it meant both roots and gave no way to specify which one we want!

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
