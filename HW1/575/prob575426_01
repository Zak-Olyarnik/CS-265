Hi Ong,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You just did prove that x is a unit,
and you even stated it.  So I'm not sure what is confusing you.

Generally, when you are given a "prove or disprove" and you're not
sure which, you should try experimenting with a few numbers and see if
it holds.  Check the most simple cases.  For example, what is a common
integral domain?  Why the integers Z of course!  Is it true for the
integers?  Then there's a pretty good chance it will also be true for
any integral domain.

Then you try to prove it for a while.  One way to prove something (or
to figure out how to prove something) is to consider what would it
mean if it was false.  Sometimes this leads you to a counterexample. 
Sometimes it leads you to a proof.  Of course, there are plenty of
things that no one has been able to prove despite a great deal of
effort and big incentives (such as a million dollars).

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
