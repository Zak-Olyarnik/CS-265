Hi David,

If I understand the question directly, he can _never_ get to the side
of the pond, can he?  Suppose he's 10 meters away.  After one jump,
he's 5 meters away.  Then 2 1/2 meters.  Then 1 1/4 meters. 

After each jump, we divide the distance by 2 to get the new distance.
 How many times do we have to divide a number by 2 to get all the way
to zero?
