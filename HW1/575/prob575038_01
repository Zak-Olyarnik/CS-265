Hello Seth,

Let's try to list the kinds of people:

British females
Bristish males
American females
American males

Everyone is in exactly one group.  We can then just add up the numbers.  I think that we 
should assume that girls are women, but not adults. I'll get you started.

British females: 26
Bristish males: 44-26
American females: 
American males: 17
