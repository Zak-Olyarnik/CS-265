Hi Jeanie,

The thing is, you can't just substitute numbers and draw conclusions
from that.  For example, suppose the question is:

  If x is not zero, x^2 is

  I.   Greater than x
  II.  Positive
  III. Negative
  IV.  Both I and II

If I just try some examples, like 2 or 3, I would conclude that the
answer is IV.  Even if I try negative numbers, I would arrive at that
conclusion.  But as soon as I try a fraction, e.g., 1/2, I find that
the answer must be I.

In your problem, suppose x is 1/2, and y is 1/3.  Then x^12 * y^6 will
_not_ be an integer.  But it will still be positive.  What you're
looking for is the characterization that will _always_ be correct, and
III isn't like that.

Does this make sense?
