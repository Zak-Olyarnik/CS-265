Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

There is a formal way of finding the answer. But it might be a little
advanced for a 12 year old student. The easiest way might be to list
all numbers which satisfy each criterion and find the one that appears
in all three lists.

For the first list: numbers which leave a remainder of 3 when divided
by 5:

   3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 53, 58, 63, 68, ...

The second list: numbers which leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 8:

   2, 10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98, ....

The third list: numbers which leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 9:

   4, 13, 22, 31, 40, 49, 58, 67, 76, 85, 94, 103, .....

Can you find the smallest number which appears in all three lists from
here?

I hope this helps, and please write back with any further questions
you might have.
