Parentheses make a difference when they tell you to do the operations 
in an order different from the usual order of operations. For 
instance, these are different:

  3+4*5 = 23

  (3+4)*5 = 35

because in the first one, you do the multiplication before the 
addition (the standard order of operations) but in the second, the 
parentheses tell you to do the addition first.

In the case of -3^4 and (-3)^4, the parentheses tell you to take the 
negative of 3 first, then raise it to the fourth power. Without the 
parentheses, you first raise 3 to the 4th power, then take the 
negative of the result.

I imagine that, right now, it seems more natural to you to treat 
-3 as a number, not the result of taking the negative of the number 
3. However, the rule will make sense when you work with variables. 
For instance, if x stands for the number 3, then -x^4 has to mean 
raising x to the 4th power, then taking the negative. For 
consistency, we treat the case of a number the same as the case of a 
variable. 

Because many people get confused by this, it is best to avoid 
confusion by writing -(3^4) if you mean to raise 3 to the 4th power, 
then take the negative. The parentheses aren't needed, but they make 
the meaning unquestionable.
