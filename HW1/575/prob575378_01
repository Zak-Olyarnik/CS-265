Hi Dillon,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  When I multiply your numbers, I get

   6.34987625 ,

which looks like the answer you want.

The number 1.25e21 should be interpreted as 1.25*10^21, just as 
1.363 * 10e-22 is 1.363*10^(-22) .

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
