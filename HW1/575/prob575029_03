Hi again,

To make the statements true, simply follow the indications I gave you 
in my previous answer.

For example, if f is surjective, the first statement is true; more 
generally, you can say that if I is an ideal of R, then f(I) is 
always an ideal of f(R) (f is surjective if f(R) = S).

For the second statement, it will be true if I contains ker f. 
Indeed, assume that x is an element of R \ I (the complement of I). 
If f(x) is in f(I), then there is some x' in I such that f(x) = f
(x'). This means that x - x' is in ker f, and, as ker f is a subset 
of I, this implies that x is in I, contrary to the hypothesis. 
Therefore f(x) is not in f(I), and f(I) is a proper ideal.

(More generally, the quotient rings f(R)/f(I) and R/I are isomorphic 
when I contains ker f)

For the second question, I believe the statement is true. Let us 
write:

  I = f^(-1)(J) = {x in R | f(x) in J}

then f(I) is a subset of J (with equality if f is surjective).

Assume that we have x and y in R such that x*y is in I. This means 
that f(x*) = f(x)*f(y) is in J.

As J is prime, one of the factors (for example, f(x)) is in J, and 
this means that x is in I, by the defition of I.
