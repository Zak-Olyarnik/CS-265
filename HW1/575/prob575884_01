Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Your answer of 25 students is correct. An average means that some
students will weigh more than the mean and some students will weigh
less than the mean. 

Let's use an example to see where this question might be going. Let's
say we had some small cats and that their weights were:

   5, 8, 6, 9, 9, 10, 14, 11, 9

The total weight of the cats is 81 lbs, and the mean weight is 9 lbs.
That doesn't mean that every cat weighs 9 pounds, or that there can't
be cats that weigh more or less than 9 lbs.

To be honest, this question doesn't have a single good answer. There
are 3 possible answers to this question. But the easiest answer is
that half the remaining students weigh more than 125lbs. and half the
remaining students weigh less than 125 lbs. In other words, not
counting the 3 students who weigh exactly 125 lbs., there are 22
students. If the median weight is 125 lbs, we expect half these 22
students to weigh more than 125 and half these 22 students to weigh less.

Does this help? Please write back with any additional questions you
might have.
