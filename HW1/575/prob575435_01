Hi Brandon,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I think you mean

  f(x) = (r^2 - x^2) ^ (1/2).

You can use trigonometric substitutions to do this.  Have you learned
that integration technique yet?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
