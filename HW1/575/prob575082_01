We've heard that there are texts that either teach a "new" rule that 
implied multiplication is done first, or that follow such a rule 
without saying it. That rule is what would make someone get 7 as the 
answer in your problems. See this page:

  Order of Operations Dispute
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/57025.html

Can you tell me what your text is, and how it states the order of 
operations rules? I am trying to gather information on this question.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
