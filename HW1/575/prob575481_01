Hi Ash,
you don't have to use the cosine law, but it is easier!

When you're using the cosine law, you eventually get to
something like
cos(C) = (some number).
Then you do
C = (inverse cosine) (some number).
Now, with inverse cosine function, there's only one answer between
0 and 180 degrees, and since you have a triangle, that's your answer!

When you use the sine law, though, you get
sin(C) = (some number)
and so
C = (inverse sine) (some number).

With inverse sine, there's only one answer between -90 and 90 degrees,
and that's the answer your calculator will give you.  BUT because it's
true that sin(x) = sin(180 - x), there are TWO answers between 0
and 180 degrees!  Sometimes both answers are possible, but in this
case where you know all three side lengths, only one of the answers
can be correct.  You can figure out which by making sure that the angles
add up to 180 in the end.

It's good to know that inverse sine gives TWO answers for possible
triangle angles -- there are times (like in the SSA case) where you need
both.  But it's a lot easier to use the law of cosines whenever you
can because it only ever gives one possible value for the angle.

Some examples, just in case the above wasn't clear:
if you have
cos(C) = 1/2 then C must equal 60 degrees.
If you look at the unit circle, C could be -60 degrees also, but
in a triangle that doesn't make much sense!

But if you have
sin(C) = sqrt(3)/2
then your calculator will say C is 60 degrees,
but if you look at the unit circle you can see that C = 120 degrees
(180 - 60) is also possible!

Let me know if you still have questions on this -- it's a tricky topic!
