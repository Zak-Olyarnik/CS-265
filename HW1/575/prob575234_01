Hi Pamela,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  You have that

     a + ar = 3.5   (or 7/2)

and you correctly deduced that

      a*r^2 = 7.875   (or 7 7/8, or 63/8) .

Factor the left side of the first equation, and divide the second 
equation by the first equation.  This will give you an equation 
which can be re-written as a quadratic equation in r.  Once you
have solved for r, you can solve for a.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
