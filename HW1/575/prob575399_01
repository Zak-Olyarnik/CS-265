Hi Kenneth,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  They are called "operations" and not
"compositions."  In fact, operations are really just functions on two
variables,

  +: F x F -> F

(also known as a two-ary or binary function), except that we write a+b
instead of +(a, b).  So anyway something like your set would be called
a field with a function ¤ on two variables which has the properties
you described.  There is no more special name for a three-operation set.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
