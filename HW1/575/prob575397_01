You can start with a very useful theorem about isosceles triangles: 
The altitude to the base bisects both the base and the apex angle.

If you draw that altitude, you have created two congruent right 
triangles. You know the hypotenuse and the angles. Then you can apply 
right-triangle trigonometry: the cosine of the base angle is equal to 
the ratio of the side adjacent to the angle (which is half the base 
of the isosceles triangle) to the hypotenuse.

If the triangle is ABC where B is the apex, so that b = AC is the 
base you seek, and a = BC and c = AB are the equal sides, then we can 
write

  cos(A) = (b/2)/c

Solve for b:

  b = 2c*cos(A)

Does this meet your needs?
