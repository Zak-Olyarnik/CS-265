Hi Elisabeth,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Can you write out a formula for the
stereographic projection?  Given a point on the sphere, what complex
number does it go to?

Now, given a point on the sphere, what is the point diametrically
opposite that point?

What complex number does that point go to?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
