Hi Paul,

First, get the total time worked by everybody:

Paul: 2 hours
John: 4 hours
Peter: 3 hours
Martin: 4 hours
Jane: 1 hour

Altogether, there were 14 total hours of work put in.

Thus, Paul should get 2/14 of the total, John 4/14 of the total, and
so on.

Paul gets 500(2/14) = 71.42857, et cetera.
