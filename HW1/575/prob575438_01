Hi Rebecca,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The formulas are

  A + B = 7
  B + C = 12
  AC = 24.

You can solve this either by factoring 24 (there are only eight things
A can be from the last equation alone - check all 8) or solving for A
and C in the first two equations, substituting into the third, and
solving that quadratic for B.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
