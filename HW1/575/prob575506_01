Can you figure out how many seconds are in a minute?
How many seconds are in an hour?
You might use the number of seconds in a minute, and minutes
in an hour, to help figure it out.


Can you figure out how many seconds are in a day?

Give those a try, and write back to let me know where you get stuck
on your way to figuring out how many seconds in a year, so I can
give more specific help with your exact problem.
