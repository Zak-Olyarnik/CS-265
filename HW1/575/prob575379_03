Hi again Gunnar,

<x,6> is the ideal of Z[x] generated by the polynomials x and 6, 
i.e., the set:

  {x*f(x) + 6*g(x)}

where f(x) and g(x) run through all the elements of the ring, in this 
case, the polynomials with integer coefficients.

Intuitively, <x,6> is the set of integer polynomials whose constant 
term is divisible by 6; <x> is the set of such polynomials whose 
constant term is 0.

Does this make sense ?
