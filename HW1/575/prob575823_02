Hello Wai,

Your calculations look good.  I'll put them is a slightly more general context.

We know that if w=f(x,y,z) is a function of three variables, then

f(x+dx,y+dy,z+dz) - f(x,y,z) = delta f   is approximately equal to

         df =  f_x(x,y,z)*dx + f_y(x,y,z)*dy + f_z(x,y,z)*dz.

If (x,y,z) = (x0,y0,z0) are the measured quantities and x0+dx, y0+dy, z0+dz are the true 
quantitities, where we know something about how large dx, dy, and dz can be, then

f(x0+dx,y0+dy,z0+dz) is approximately equal to 

                f(x0,y0,z0) + f_x(x0,y0,z0)*dx + f_y(x0,y0,z0)*dy + f_z(x0,y0,z0)*dz.

We can calculate the right side, choosing the signs of dx, dy, dz so as to maximize the 
right side. (in your case, everything is positive)
