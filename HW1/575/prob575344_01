I agree with you that they are being pretty sloppy about 
"definitions"! But I know of no term for a "scalene" quadrilateral 
(I'm pretty sure that term is not valid) -- or for that matter, for 
a non-square rhombus! -- so probably the best approach here is not 
to find correct term for each phrase, but to interpret the 
instructions as you suggest, as looking for the most specific term 
applicable to each case.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
