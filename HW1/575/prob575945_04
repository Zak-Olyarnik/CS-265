Generally, you can recognize this kind of identity by trying to solve
it and seeing that all real numbers make it true. You solve an
equation by transforming it to a simpler one that is equivalent; if
you can transform it to an identity -- such as the equation 0=0 --
then you have shown that your equation is an identity.

That may be more or less difficult depending on what kind of equation
you are working with, but for basic linear equations it is not hard.

Here is an example. Take the equation

  3(2x - 4) = 2(3x - 6)

Simplifying both sides, this becomes

  6x - 12 = 6x - 12

Since the two sides are identical, this is clearly true for all x, and
therefore so is the original equation.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
