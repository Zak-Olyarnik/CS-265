Here is my favorite way to factor trinomials like this:

  Finding a Single Pair of Factors
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/53308.html

If you are using that method, you want to find a pair of numbers 
whose product is not 4, but 12 times 4 (that is, 48), and whose sum 
is 19. That's not hard to find.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
