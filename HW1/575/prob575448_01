It depends on what you consider a "3-sided object". Since any 3-
sided POLYGON is by definition a triangle, you must mean something 
other than a polygon. If, for example, the sides are curved; or if 
they do not form a simple closed "curve" (that is, meet at three 
vertices, enclosing a space), then it will not be a triangle.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
