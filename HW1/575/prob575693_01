Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

This is a rate problem:

    work = rate * time

Let's say the rates of the pumps are x and y.

Together, they empty a fuel tank in 5 hours:

  1 tank = (x + y) * 5

   x + y = 1/5 tank/hr

Let's say that x is the rate of the faster pump, and that it empties a
tank on its own in t time, or:

   1 tank = x * t

We know the slower pump takes 4 more hours, or:

   1 tank = y * (t + 4)

We now have enough equations to solve the problem:

   x+y = 1/5
     1 = x*t
     1 = y*(t+4)

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
