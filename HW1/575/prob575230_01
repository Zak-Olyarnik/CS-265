Morris:
Welcome to the exciting world of mathematics.

The volume of a cylinder is found by multiplying the radius times the 
radius times pi times the height.
i.e. V = (pi)x(r)x(r)x(h).

This will give you the volume in cubic units. 

Now it is important to make sure that the units are inches, since 
there are 231 cubic inches in 1 gallon.

So, find the radius (conver to inches), find the height (convert to 
inches), use the (V)olume formula above, and then divide the number 
of cubic inches by 231 to find the gallons. 

example:  radius = 4 inches
          height = 5 inches
          pi     = 3.14  (good approximation)

V = (pi) x (r)x(r)x(h)
  = 3.14 x  4 x 4 x 5 
  = 251.2 cubic inches

Gallons = 251.2/231 which is about 1.09 gallons. 

If you need further assistance with this matter, please feel free to
