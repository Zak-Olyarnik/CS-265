Hi, Matthew --

I don't know the context in which you encountered this problem, so I 
don't know what methods you are allowed to use to determine the 
answer.

There is a whole area of mathematics related to finding the sums of 
series like this.  I know very little about that field of math; I 
have no idea how to find this sum analytically.

However, this particular sum lends itself quite easily to 
calculation using a spreadsheet.  A few minutes building a 
spreadsheet showed me that the infinite sum of this series is 
(apparently) 5/16 = 0.3125.

I am leaving your question where other math doctors here can see it, 
and I am inviting any of them who is well versed in this area to 
take a look at it and see if they can help.
