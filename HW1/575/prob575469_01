Any good English dictionary (including on-line dictionaries like m-
w.com) will give at least a brief summary of the roots. Also, go to 
our FAQ and look for the link to Math Words, near the bottom. That 
is a source of exactly the information you are looking for. Or, 
search our site for the word "etymology" together with any word of 
interest.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
