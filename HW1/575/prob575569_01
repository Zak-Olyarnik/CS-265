Let's look at a smaller version of the same kind of problem...

   I'm thinking of an integer.
   All the digits are different. 
   It's a multiple of 3 and 11.  
   The tens digits is a square number.
   The hundreds digit is a cube. 
   The ones digit is 5 less than the hundreds digit.

We can start by making places for the digits.
 
   ___ ___ ___ 
    |   |   |_____ ones
    |   |_________ tens
    |_____________ hundreds


The tens digit is a square number.  That means it's some other digit
times itself.  The only possibilities are:

   0 = 0*0
   1 = 1*1
   4 = 2*2
   9 = 3*3

So let's indicate that it has to be one of these:

        0
        1
        4
        9
   ___ ___ ___ 
    |   |   |_____ ones
    |   |_________ tens
    |_____________ hundreds


The hundreds digit is a cube.  Again, there aren't many possibilities:

   0 = 0*0*0
   1 = 1*1*1
   8 = 2*2*2

And we wouldn't have a zero at the beginning of a number. So now we have

        0
    1   1
        4
    8
        9
   ___ ___ ___ 
    |   |   |_____ ones
    |   |_________ tens
    |_____________ hundreds

The ones digit is five less than the hundreds digit.  What this tells
us is the the hundreds digit can't be a 1.  Which means it has to be
an 8.  And the ones digit is a 3, because that's 5 less than 8:

        0
        1
            3
        4
    8
        9
   ___ ___ ___ 
    |   |   |_____ ones
    |   |_________ tens
    |_____________ hundreds

So now we're down to 

  803, 813, 843, and 893

But only one of these is divisible by 11, which is 803.  So the number
must be 803. 

Can you see how to use the same kind of reasoning to solve your problem?
