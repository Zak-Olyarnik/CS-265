Hi Claudia,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I would start by dividing one side of
the equation by the other.  That gives you a ratio whose absolute
value you know.  Give the ratio a new name, like r or b, which is a
complex number with what absolute value?  Now solve for z.  Great. 
Does that help?  Well, multiply z by z-bar, and now what do you get?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
