Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Zero is a number. The empty set is a set. In other words, consider a
basket with 1 apple. The basket represents a set here. There is a
difference between a basket containing 1 apple and just 1 apple.
Likewise, a set acts as a "basket" for things. The empty set is the
empty "basket". Zero is the number which tells you "how many" apples
are in the basket.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
