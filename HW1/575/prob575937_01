Hi Lynn,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  In the first problem, you need to 
realize that technically a limit is not computed by just substituting
the limiting value of x, although most limit problems may give you
that impression.  To determine

   lim f(x)
  x->a

you are supposed to examine the values of f(x) for x very very close 
to, but different from, a and to determine if the values f(x) are
getting closer and closer to something as x gets closer and closer to
a.  Most limit problems usually given involve manipulating or 
simplifying f(x) to show that for x not equal to a, f(x) is equal to
a continuous function g(x), and the definition of continuity is
that

   lim g(x) = g(a) .
  x->a

That is, continuous functions are exactly the functions whose limits
can be computed by evaluation.  But this doesn't help in figuring out
limits such as

        sin(x)
   lim  ------   or   lim x*sin(1/x)  .
  x->0     x         x->0

I think what the problem wants is for you to substitute numbers x which
are very close to 2, such as 2.1, 2.01, 2.001, 2.0001, etc. and see
if the values f(2.1),f(2.01),f(2.001),... get closer and closer to 
something, as they must if the expression has a limit.

>2. Discuss the continuity of: f(x)= (2-x)/((x^2)-4)

I gave the definition of continuity above, and this has three parts:

 (1) lim f(x) exists;
    x->a

  (2) f(a) is defined;

  (3) the two are equal.

The expression

   lim f(x) = f(a) 
  x->a

requires all three statements to be true.  You need to consider all
possible values of a, and determine for which a these three conditions
are true.  (For most values of a, the three conditions are easy; there
are only a few points where there is any question.)

>3. Find: lim(x->0)  ((1)/(Square root of 1+x))-1   <-thats all on 
>the numerator    /x

First, you have a complicated fraction, whose numerator is itself
a fraction.  Use algebra to rewrite the expression as a single
fraction.  Then rationalize, which will algebraically simplify the
expression and make it easier to find the limit.

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
