Hi Ben,
"kilo" means 1000,
so a kilometer is 1000 meters,
a kilogram is 1000 grams,
and so on.

Sometimes a kilobyte is 1000 bytes, and sometimes it's 1024, but
that's just because computer programmers think in terms of 2s instead
of 10s.  Other than a few computer examples like that, kilo is always
1000.
