Hi, Raghav --

Well, now we're stuck.  None of the possible answers which satisfied 
the other two conditions is a square number.  Also, there is no 
square number in which the sum of the digits is 3.

There is no number which satisfies all the conditions you have 
stated:

(1) < 200
(2) divisible by 6
(3) sum of digits is 3
(4) square number
