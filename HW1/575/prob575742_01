Suppose there were 40 persons in the class.

Each person can shake 39 other hands.

That appears to give 40 x 39 handshakes, but of course each 
handshake has been counted twice - once for each person involved.

So total number is actually 40 x 39/2 = 780 handshakes.

You can also work this out from  C(40,2) = number of combinations of 
2 people that can be formed from 40 people.

The general formula for a class of size n is  n(n-1)/2
