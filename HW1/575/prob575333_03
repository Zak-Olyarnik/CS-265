That's fine, Jen, we'll write it your way.

First of all, that -1 needs an exponent, and I imagine you can guess
what the exponent is.  Do you know why it has to be there?

Secondly, if you look at the first few derivatives you wrote out (y,
y', y", etc) you will probably find that some of them don't match up
with your f's.  There is another factor that you are missing.  Do you
know what it is?

Finally, if you only want

   (n)
  f   (0)

instead of

   (n)
  f   (x),

then there is a much easier way to do this using the Taylor
polynomial.  First you write out the Taylor series for

  sin(x).

Then you substitute pi*x for x to get the Taylor series for

  sin(pi*x).

Finally, you use this Taylor series to get all of the n'th derivatives
at zero.  (This only works to get that one value of each of the
derivatives, though, and not the derivative function.)
