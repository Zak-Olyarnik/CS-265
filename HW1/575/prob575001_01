Hi, Jennie --

This is quite a difficult problem to solve.  Here is a link to a 
page in the Dr. Math archives where you can find a detailed solution 
to the problem, as well as a link to another page in the archives 
containing a quite different analysis (but the same solution):

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
