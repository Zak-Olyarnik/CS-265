Your original question was:

Because of the term "floating-point," I wonder if you are referring 
to writing a computer program. If you've got two variables, say A and 
B, you'll want to first find the difference of the numbers. This, as 
I said, will involve an absolute value; perhaps your computer 
language has a function such as abs() or fabs() which returns the 
absolute value of its argument. If so, the difference of A and B will 
be something like abs(A-B). Divide this by an expression for the 
product of A and B -- that is, A*B (if "*" is the operator for 
multiplication).

I can't be much more help without more context. I cannot tell what it 
is that confuses you, nor can I tell what exactly you need to do and 
what you have to work with.
