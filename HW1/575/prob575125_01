Hi Elle,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

What is the value of y at the x-intercept?

If you substitute that number in for "y" in your equation and then 
solve for x, the answer will be the x-intercept.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
