Hi Daphne,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  While the "them" in your sentence
doesn't make sense to me, I think what you are trying to say is:

  Compare and contrast
     the method to solve equations
  with
     the method to solve a quadratic or rational inequality.

So you should ask your daughter:  How do you solve equations?  (Her
answer is the method.)  Then ask:  How do you solve inequalities?

If she wonders what an inequality is, it is something like this:

  x^2 + 2x - 5 < 10.

This is a quadratic inequality (quadratic = polynomial whose biggest
exponent is x^2).  Rational means a polynomial divided by a
polynomial, so a rational inequality is something like this:

  x^2 - 3x + 7
  ------------ < 26.
      x + 2

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
