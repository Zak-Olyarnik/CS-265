Hi Charlie,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Please go to our FAQ at

  Perfect numbers
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.perfect.html

which you could also have found by searching our archives for "perfect
number."

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
