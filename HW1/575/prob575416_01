Hi Deb,

Go to our search page at

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/mathgrepform.html

and search for the phrase

  Fermat's Last Theorem.

That theorem is the theorem that says that the only solutions to

   n    n    n
  x  + y  = z

where x, y, z, and n are all positive integers have n <= 2.

I hope this helps.  Let me know if you'd like to talk about 
this some more, or if you have any other questions.
