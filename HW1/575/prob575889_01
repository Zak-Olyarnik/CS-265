Hi, Madeline --

You have made an excellent start on this.  Let's look at your 
analysis...

  "say you have 2 hexagons you would multiply it by 6 because
   thats how many sides it has then subtract 2 because those
   2 sides are facing each other. Each time the number you
   subtract will get 2 bigger."

Let's use this analysis to find the perimeter for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 
hexagons; then we will look at the pattern of numbers we have and 
try to put it in a formula.

  1 hexagon:  6 sides; perimeter = 6
  2 hexagons:  2 times 6 sides, minus 2; perimeter = 12-2 = 10
  3 hexagons:  3 times 6 sides, minus 4; perimeter = 18-4 = 14
  4 hexagons:  4 times 6 sides, minus 6; perimeter = 24-6 = 18
  5 hexagons:  5 times 6 sides, minus 8; perimeter = 30-8 = 22

So for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hexagons, the perimeters are

  6, 10, 14, 18, 22

Written in function notation, where P(n) is the perimeter of the 
figure made up of n hexagons, we have

  P(1) = 6
  P(2) = 10
  P(3) = 14
  P(4) = 18
  P(5) = 22

The perimeter of the figure increases by 4 each time we add another 
hexagon.  A formula which will behave this way (the perimeter 
increasing by 4 each time we add one hexagon) is of the form

  P(n) = 4n + <something>

We just need to figure out what the <something> is.  To do this, we 
can use any of our known values of the function.  Let's use P(1)=6, 
since it is the smallest number.  We know

  P(n) = 4n + <something>

so for n=1 we have

  P(1) = 4(1) + <something>
       = 4 + <something>

But we know P(1) = 6, so

  4 + <something> = 6

and so that <something> is 2.

So now our formula is complete:

  P(n) = 4n+2

We can check a couple of our other known values to give us 
confidence in our formula:

  P(2) = 4(2)+2 = 8+2 = 10  yes...
  P(5) = 4(5)+2 = 20+2 = 22  yes...

Now that we have confidence in our formula, we can find the 
perimeter for larger numbers of hexagons.  For the two cases you 
mention in your message to us, we have

  P(100) = 4(100)+2 = 402
  P(11) = 4(11)+2 = 46

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
