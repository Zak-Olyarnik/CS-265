Hi Jen,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You will have four cases, according to
whether n is divisible by 4, or 1, 2, or 3 more than a multiple of 4.
 That is, your answer should look like

   (n)     -----  if n = 4k for some integer k
  y    = { -----  if n = 4k+1 for some integer k
           -----  if n = 4k+2 for some integer k
           -----  if n = 4k+3 for some integer k.

(Actually, you can combine them into only two cases, but it will
probably be easier to think of them as four.)  You're doing fine at
finding the derivatives (except for y' - remember that the derivative
of sin x is +cos x not -cos x), so all you have to do now is find the
pattern and write out the formulas.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
