Hi Jason,

I'm sorry about being unhelpful.  I can't tell you where your
reduction of the equation went wrong, because you didn't tell me how
you reduced the equation.

What I was trying to say was:  It doesn't cancel out, so don't try to
make it cancel out.

You asked when is Q > 0.  I said to look at the signs of the numerator
and denominator, and you noticed that the numerator is never negative
since it's a square, so the only way Q will be positive is if the
denominator is positive.

So when is the denominator positive?

The denominator is

  p - 2.66

(according to your original question).  So if it is positive, then
that means

  p - 2.66 > 0.

So what p does this give you?

Now if the denominator is positive, then Q will also be positive
*unless* the numerator is zero.  Could the numerator possibly be zero
when the denominator is positive?  When is the numerator zero?  (The
quadratic formula and a calculator can answer that question.)

Is that more helpful?
