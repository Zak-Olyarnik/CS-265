Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Your intuition is correct. The probability remains at 20% for
everybody. We can calculate it, in fact.

Person A draws the short straw 20% of the time. In this case, the
probability Person B draws the short straw 0% of the time.
Person A draws a long straw 80% of the time. In this case, Person B
draws the short straw 25% of the time.

 Prob(Person B draws short) = Prob(Person B - short |Person A - short)
                             + Prob(Person B - short |Person A - long)

                            = 20% * 0 + 80% * 25%
                            = 20%

So, on average, Person B draws the short straw 20% of the time. 

Using a similar calculation, you can show that Persons C, D, and E
draw the short straw 20% of the time.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
