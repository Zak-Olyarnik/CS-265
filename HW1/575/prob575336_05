That's correct.

>4 and 5 are relatively prime.

Exactly.  Now if 4 and 5 have no common factor, but 5 divides 4a, then
what does that tell you about a?

Um, well... yeah, but....  Divisible by 5 means that the number is
some integer times 5.  If you write a number divisible by 5 in
decimal, then you will get a 5 or 0 in the last digit, but that's not
really what divisible by 5 means.  Rather, that's the way to check if
a number is divisible by 5.

So you have

  4a = 5(b+c),

and b+c is an integer, so that means that 4a is divisible by 5, right?
 So 4a has 5 as a factor.  But 4 doesn't, so a does, right?
