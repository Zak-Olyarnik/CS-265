Hi Ehab,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  These problems appear to be 
fairly straightforward induction arguments.

The base case is given.  If y_n < 4, then what difficulty are you
having showing that y_(n+1) < 4?

One way to word the problem is to show that y_(n+1) - y_n > 0 for
all n.  The base case is a direct computation, since you have y_1 and
the recurrence formula.  Then if y_n - y(n-1) > 0, can you show that
y_(n+1) - y_n > 0?

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
