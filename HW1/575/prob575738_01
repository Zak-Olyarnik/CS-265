Hi, Marcus --

54.

This is about the 50th time in the last two weeks I have seen this 
problem, and it's really been bugging me.  I don't generally like 
problems like this, because there are so many different possible 
relationships between the numbers that it is quite possible to come 
up with a relationship which produces an answer very different than 
the one the creator of the problem had in mind.

So when I saw your message I decided to try a really off-the-wall 
relationship.

Look at the numbers of letters in the two "input" numbers in each 
case and compare that to the "output" number....
