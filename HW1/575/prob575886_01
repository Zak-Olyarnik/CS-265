The lockers left open will be those with numbers that are perfect 
squares.

If a number is a perfect square it will have an odd number of 
factors, e.g 4 has factors 1, 2, 4, whereas all other numbers have 
an even number of factors.  If a particular locker is visited an odd 
number of times it will be open at the end of the procedure you 
describe, otherwise it will be closed.  So the open lockers are 
numbered:

 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ..... 900, 961

The last number is 31^2  so 31 is the number of lockers left open.


Explanation
------------

To show that square numbers always have an odd number of factors, 
consider a square like 36

This can be put into prime factors as  2^2 x 3^2.  Note that all its 
prime factors will be raised to EVEN powers since it is a perfect 
square.

Now the factor 2 can be chosen in 3 ways, i.e. not at all, once, 
twice.

And factor 3 can also be chosen in 3 ways, i.e. not at all, once, or 
twice.

(If neither are chosen we get the factor 2^0 x 3^0 = 1)

Altogether there will be 3 x 3 = 9 factors of 36.  These are:

  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36

Now the important point was made earlier that the prime factors of a 
perfect square are always raised to some even power, so we could 
have 
 
  a^2 x b^4 x c^2  where a, b, c are primes.

In this example a could be chosen in 3 ways  0 times, once or twice.
                b could be chosen in 5 ways  0 times, 1, 2, 3, 4 
times
                c could be chosen in 3 ways  0 times, 1, 2, times

So altogether the complete number will have  3 x 5 x 3 = 45 factors.

For any number that is not a perfect square there will ALWAYS be an 
even number of factors

 e.g.   a^3 x b^2 x c  will have   4 x 3 x 2 factors = 24 factors

If it is not a perfect square at least one of its prime factors will 
be raised to an ODD power, and that means the factor can be chosen 
in an EVEN number of ways, ensuring that overall there will be an 
even number of factors.

The general rule for the number of factors is to increase the powers 
of the factors by 1 and multiply these together.

So  a^n x b^m x c^p  will have (n+1)(m+1)(p+1) factors.

 2^3 x 5^4 x 7^2  will have  4 x 5 x 3 = 60 factors
