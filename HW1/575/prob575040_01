Hi, Crystal --

It only takes one trip.  This is a popular problem in logic; very 
few people solve it on their own, because the problem is posed in 
such a way that they put restrictions on the problem which do not 
exist.

You need to "think outside the box", as the popular phrase says.  
Certainly, when you leave the room where the switches are and go to 
the room where the light bulbs and lamps are, you can have one 
switch on and the other two off; then one of the three lights will 
be on, allowing you to identify one switch/lamp pair.

To finish solving the problem, you need to find a way that you can 
determine which of the other two switches controls which of the 
other two lamps.  You need to think of the physical situation -- not 
just the logical problem.  What can you do with the switches before 
you go to the room with the lights so that you will be able to 
determine which of the other two switches controls which of the 
other two lamps?

I hope this much helps.  Please write back if you need more help 
with this.
