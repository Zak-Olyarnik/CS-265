You're told that the first and last numbers are perfect squares, which
means they can only be certain numbers: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on,
which are the squares of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. The latter numbers
are their square roots. So if the first and last were 16 and 25, then
their square roots would be 4 and 5, and the middle number would be 9.

Does that help?
