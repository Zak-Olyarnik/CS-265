Hi Gunnar,

Both statements are false.

For the first statement, consider, for example, the ring R = Z[x], 
i.e., the polynomials with integer coefficients.

Take I = <x>, J = <x,6>. I is prime and a subset of J, but J contains 
2*3 = 6, and does not contain either 2 or 3.

For the second statement, it is also possible that r is an associate 
of s, i.e., that r = u*s, where u is a unit. For example, in Z, 2 
and -2 are prime and divide each other.

Does this help?  Write back if you'd like to talk about this 
some more, or if you have any other questions.
