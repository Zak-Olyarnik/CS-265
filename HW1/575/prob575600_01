Hello Marie,

The idea is that how should both of them play if they both make
the best possible moves?

Here's how I'd think about it: look at small games:

If there are 1, 2 or 3 coins, then the person whose move it is wins,
since he/she will just take all of them.

So if it's your move, you do NOT want to leave 1, 2 or 3 coins,
but you would like to leave 0 coins.

So think about "safe" positions to leave after you have moved.  If
you leave 0, that is safe (since you win!)  If you leave 1, 2 or 3,
those are not safe.

How about leaving 4?  What can your opponent do if you leave
4?  No matter what he/she does (taking 1, 2 or 3) will leave
a non-safe position for him/her, so leaving 4 is safe for you.

5, 6 and 7 are dangerous (non-safe) positions, since your
opponent can turn any of them into 4, which is safe for him,
but dangerous for you.

8 is safe -- do you see why?

Does this help?
