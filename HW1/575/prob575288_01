If you look in a dictionary, you will find something like this (from
m-w.com):

  : a proposition or theorem formed by contradicting both the
  subject and predicate or both the hypothesis and conclusion of a
  given proposition or theorem and interchanging them <"if not-B
  then not-A " is the contrapositive of "if A then B ">

That entry doesn't give the roots, but that is because they are given
in the previous entry in the dictionary, for "contraposition":

  Etymology: Late Latin contraposition-, contrapositio, from Latin
  contraponere to place opposite, from contra- + ponere to place --
  more at POSITION
  : the relationship between two propositions when the subject and
  predicate of one are respectively the negation of the predicate
  and the negation of the subject of the other

From other sources, I know a little more detail: "contra" in Latin
means "against" or "opposite"; and "positive" comes from "positus",
the past participle of "ponere", which means "to put or place", and
can include the meaning "to state or propose". So the contrapositive
means "to place in opposite order" or "to state in a contrary form".
The idea is that we turn both the condition and the conclusion "inside
out" by inverting them, and also reversing their order, so that the
result is a statement of the same fact, but using contrary forms of
expression. In thus taking the inverse of the converse, we are
reversing the meaning twice and getting back to the original meaning.

Note that "positive" here does not really mean "positive" as opposed
to negative, but rather "positing" (stating) or "positioning"
(placing) something. But the idea of "positive" as "yes" and
"negative" as "no" does come from the same source. In Latin, "pono"
means "I place this before you" and "nego" means "I deny this". And it
just happens that the meaning of the contrapositive is indeed
"positive"! That's how I remember the meaning of the word: a way to
state the same thing that looks contrary to the original.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
