So we are given:
there are two natural numbers, a and b.
The sum S, or a+b, is prime.

We want to prove:
a and b have no common factor greater than 1.

Usually the way to prove those kinds of statements is to start with:
Let d be a number which is a common factor of both a and b.

Then from there, prove that d must equal 1.  Use the information
given in the problem (namely that the sum of a and b is prime) --
you won't get anywhere without that!

Does that help you get started?
