Hi KS,

Both statments are indeed false.

First question
--------------
f(I) will obviously be an additive subgroup. It will be an ideal if, 
for all s in S and i in I, sf(i) is in f(I).

If f is surjective (onto), we can write s = f(r) for some r in R, and 
we have:

  sf(i) = f(r)f(i) = f(ri)

and, as ri is in I (because I is an ideal), f(ri) is in f(I) and f(I) 
is an ideal.

This means that, to find a counter-example, f must not be surjective. 
In that case, you have an additional supply of elements of S to 
multiply with, and it is possible that some product sf(i) will not be 
in I.

The easiest example of a non-surjective homomorphism is the injection 
of a ring into a larger ring. In particular, if the larger ring is a 
field, it has no proper ideals. Try that idea with Z and Q.

Second question
---------------
By the correspondence theorem, there is a one-to-one correspondence 
between ideals of f(R) and ideals of R that contain the kernel of f. 
To find a correspondence, we must therefore find a proper ideal that 
does not contain ker f.

Consider, for example, the homomorphism

  f : Z -> Z_3

defined by f(z) = z mod 3. The kernel is 3Z. An example of a proper 
ideal of Z that does not contain 3Z is 2Z. Can you check that
f(2Z) = Z_3, i.e., is not a proper ideal ?

Does this help?  Write back if you'd like to talk about this 
some more, or if you have any other questions.
