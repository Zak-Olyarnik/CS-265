Hi Marco,

If you want to come up with a new algorithm, then you need to use some
new ideas.  I would suggest starting by trying to find efficient ways
to solve the problem using n=3 and n=4 and n=5 rings and more.  Come
up with a general technique that can be used for any number of rings.

Also, I would recommend thinking in terms of what the moves are that
you need to do before you try to program it.  For example, I wonder if
you know what the "n" in the first parameter is.  It certainly isn't
the total number of rings, or else you couldn't call

  hanoi(n-1, source, 6-source-dest)

and you should think about that last parameter.  Why is it

  6-source-dest ?

Where does that formula come from?  In fact, you'll probably have to
change the parameters of your function if you want it to tell you
moves for 4 pegs or 5 pegs, and you'll certainly have to change the
parameters if you want it to work for any number of pegs.
