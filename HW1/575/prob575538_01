Indeed, if you have negative values it doesn't make sense
to take the geometric mean.

The geometric mean would make sense if you were taking the
average multiplier for a lot of stocks:
for instance, if one stock went from 100 to 120, its multiplier would
be 1.2,
and if another stock went from 50 to 30, its multiplier would be .6,
and then you could take the geometric mean of those.  But as long
as no stock went to 0 or below, then those numbers would all
be positive.

Does that help?
