Most likely this is one of a list of problems that are preceded by
instructions like "solve each equation for the indicated variable". So
this one means that you are to solve

  n + 3 = q

for the variable n.

Your teacher should have explained this to the class; a lot of kids
seem to have trouble when they first see a problem like that,
imagining that it is some obscure mathematical notation they have
never seen, rather than something that is just being used for this
assignment!

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
