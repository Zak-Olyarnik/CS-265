Hi, Tom --

You have done most of the work you need to finish this problem....

You tried the number 242242, divided it by 7, then by 11, then by 
13, and got 242 as a result.  And you apparently realized that 
dividing by 7, then by 11, and then by 13 is the same as dividing by 
the product of those three numbers; so you determined that product 
to be 1001.

Now turn the problem around: start with 242 and multiply it by 1001; 
you get 242242.  Is that just an accident?  See what happens if you 
multiply 397 by 1001; then see what happens when you multiply 904 by 
1001; then...., etc., etc.

And now turn the problem around and explain why when you divide the 
number "ABCABC" by 7, then by 11, and then by 13 you end up with the 
number "ABC".

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you need more help with 
this.
