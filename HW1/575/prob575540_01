Hi Pat,
at the bottom right of our Frequently Asked Questions page,
there's a link to
  Mathematics Glossary for Middle-Level Students
  Simple definitions of math terms.
which is the right one to follow for this kind of question.

You won't find answers in our archives, because when people
ask for a simple definition of a term like ordered pair, we
refer everyone to the glossary!

I hope that works out for you -- let me know if you'd
like more help.
