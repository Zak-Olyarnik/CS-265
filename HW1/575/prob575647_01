Hi Morgan,

This is an excellent question.  The important thing when solving _any_
math problem is to use _whatever_ method will work best for that
problem, rather than just learning one method and trying to use it for
everything. 

If I want to subtract 1999 from 2000, I'd note that 

  2000 - 1999 = whatever I have to ADD TO 1999, to get to 2000

and since what I have to add is 1, that's the answer.  In the same
spirit, I can note that

  5000 - 20 = whatever I'd have to ADD 20 TO, to get 2000

Since adding 20 to 4800 would get me to 5000, 4800 must be the answer.

For that matter, you can even do this when the answers aren't so
obvious.  For example, given

  5231 - 2866 = ?

what I'd do in practice is think:

  Adding   34 gets me to 2900
  Adding  100 gets me to 3000
  adding 2231 gets me to 5231
         ----
         2365 <-- This is what I have to add to 2866 to get to 5231

This way, I don't do any borrowing at all.  

Note that what I'm doing here is much more important than just finding
an easier way to subtract.  What I'm doing is starting by thinking
about what the problem MEANS, rather than just trying to remember some
set of steps that I can follow without even understanding them.  

Developing this attitude is probably the single most important thing
you can do to succeed in learning math.  It will also make math a
_lot_ more fun.  See

and write back if you'd like to talk more about this, or anything else. 

I hope this helps!
