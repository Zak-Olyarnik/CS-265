You're very welcome.  More than the answer to this particular problem,
it would be great if you and your daughter would come away from this
seeing that a lot of math really _is_ pretty straightforward, if you
can keep from freaking out.  :^D

One thing that happens to a lot of students (and parents) is that when
confronted with a 'math problem', they immediately start trying to
remember 'the formula' for that kind of problem, instead of thinking
about what is actually being asked.

In this case, if you defer thinking about division and remainders, you
see that the question looks like this:

  There are three lists of numbers.
  What is the smallest number that appears in all three lists? 

When you look at it this way, the path to the solution seems pretty clear:

  Generate the lists.
  Look for the first number that appears in all three. 

All I added to that was paying attention to each list as I generated
it, to see if I could avoid generating values that couldn't possibly
help me (such as numbers ending in '3').  But that extra stuff wasn't
really necessary to solve the problem.  It just saved me a little work.
