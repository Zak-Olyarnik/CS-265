Hi Kent,

Sometimes the best way to deal with a question like this is to turn it
into an equivalent, or complementary, question.  To get 70% on the
test, we need to get 7 questions correct. 

How many ways can we get 7 questions correct?  That's the same as
asking: How many ways can we get 3 questions wrong? 

Let's say we put each question by itself on a slip of paper, and drop
all the slips into a hat.  Now we want to know how many ways we can
draw three of them out of the hat.

There are 10 different ways we can choose the first one.  Having
chosen that, there are 9 different ways to choose the second.  Having
chosen those, there are 8 different ways to choose the third. 

So there are 10*9*8 different ways to choose the questions.  However,
the order isn't important, e.g., 5-8-3 is the same as 3-5-8.  Using
similar reasoning to that above, there are 3*2*1 ways to order any set
of 3 choices, so the number of combinations is 

                                  10*9*8
 number of ways to get 3 wrong =  ------ 
                                   3*2*1

If we think about it, we can see that dealing with correct answers
works the same way, but with more values:

                                  10*9*8*7*6*5*4
 number of ways to get 7 right =  --------------------
                                         7*6*5*4*3*2*1

                                 10*9*8
                               = ------
                                  3*2*1

Does this make sense?
