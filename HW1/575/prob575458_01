I know of no rules for this; some publications may well have their own
standards, but usage varies considerably. I would tend to agree with
you as to general mathematical use, that (except in fields where
braces or brackets have special uses and are not used for mere
grouping) the three symbols are interchangeable, and that it is
perfectly acceptable to use only the one form if you choose. But I
don't think it's uncommon to use [] on the outside (in fact, it may be
usual), and I would have no problems doing so.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
