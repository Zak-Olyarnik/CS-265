Hi Sea,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  I don't know what your question is,
but you can learn all you want about interest rates from our FAQ

  Loans and interest
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.interest.html

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
