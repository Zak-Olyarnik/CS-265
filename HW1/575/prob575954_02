Hi Sheila,

The easy way to do it is to convert each mixed number to an improper
fraction:

  1 7/8     15/8
 ------- = ------
  3 1/3     10/3

Then you just divide the fractions, by inverting and multiplying by
the denominator:

  1 7/8     15/8    15    3   45
 ------- = ------ = -- * -- = --
  3 1/3     10/3     8   10   80

Then you can simplify, if you want; and if the result is improper, you
can convert back to a mixed number. 

If you're not sure how to do the conversions, take a look at

Does this help?
