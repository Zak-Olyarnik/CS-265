I am not sure from your response whether you understand yet or not. 
You need to divide the difference by the product, simply because that 
is what the program is supposed to print. If, in response to the 
prompt for input, I enter 2.5 and 3.2, the program should print the 
difference (3.2 - 2.5 = 1.7) divided by the product (2.5 * 3.2 = 
8.0). In other words the program will print out the number 0.2125.
