Hi, Lora --

Knowing that this is a problem for a 5th grader helps; as hard as it 
is to see, there has to be some relatively simple pattern in the 
numbers.  It took me several minutes and several false starts before 
I saw it....

Try "folding" the sequence of numbers in half and see how the 
numbers "pair up":

  ?? 144
   2  72
   3  ??
  ??  36
   6  24
  ??  16
    12

Do you see the relationship...?

I hope this helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about this.
