That's a very clever idea, Katie!  I think that's the key to the problem.  If the boxes are 
separate, then there's no way you can do it, since the sum of four odd numbers is 
always even.  Suppose you put each box inside the next larger box.  Now you could 
put, say 3 counters in the innermost box and then add counters in each outer box to 
make the total come out to 9.  Give it another try.
