Hi Arber,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The answer to your question depends
heavily on exactly what you planned to do with your math.  To say
"non-ordinary" means nothing to me, and "science-oriented" is pretty
vague.

If you plan to do something like computational physics, then you will
need a solid foundation in advanced calculus, differential equations,
and probably complex numbers and probability (both are used a lot in
quantum physics, for example).

Abstract algebra has myriad applications in many places, but a
specific science application doesn't come to mind.  On the other hand,
it is a great tool to develop mental discipline.  That and, more so,
number theory probably has more applications in computers (such as
cryptology) than in science.

As for numerical methods and optimization, yes, that's where
mathematics and computer science meet.  You'll probably find that kind
of mathematics most applicable to computer science.  Some
computational scientists use tools developed by others, but I hear
that many need to develop their own tools to implement their own
techniques to solve their own problems.  So you'll probably find that
useful.

I'll leave your question on the board in case someone else has other
opinions, although getting two answers to a question is not especially
common.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back, and I will try to offer further suggestions.
