You're right: a rhombus is a parallelogram, but a special one that has
some extra features other parallelograms don't have. That's why it has
a name of its own, though it could just be called a parallelogram, and
sometimes is when we aren't paying attention to the lengths of the sides.

It's sort of like that fact that a Persian is a cat, but a special
kind of cat.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
