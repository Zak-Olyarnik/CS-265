Hi Linda,

If you're trying to simplify something like 

    ___
  \/4/6

the first step would generally be to simplify the fraction inside the
radical, i.e., 

    ___     ___
  \/4/6 = \/2/3

At this point, there's not a lot you can do, unless you're supposed to
'rationalize the denominator', in which case you do this:

     __      _
    | 2    \/2
    | -  = ---  
   \| 3      _
           \/3


             _      _
           \/2    \/3
         = ---- * ----
             _      _
           \/3    \/3      <-- This gets rid of the radical in
                               the denominator

             _   
           \/6 
         = ----
             3  

Note that none of the forms is incorrect.  And it's hard to say with a
straight face that 

     _                    __
   \/6                   | 2
   --- is simpler than   | -
    3                   \| 3


However, some people - in particular, teachers - prefer the former to
the latter.  And since they get to give out grades, it's prudent to
humor them. 

Does this help?
