Hi Rahul,

You don't have to show that a is divisible by 5.  You could just try
every possible value for a.

But if you want to...

Do you know what "divisible by 5" means?  Tell me.

Do you know what "relatively prime" means?

Are 4 and 5 relatively prime?

Alternately, notice that 5 is a prime number.  If a prime number
divides m*n, then what does that tell you about m and n?
