Isaac Newton was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, or "held the
Lucasian chair", which means that his job was funded and named in
honor of a man named Lucas. Here is a description of it, talking about
the first to hold that chair:

  In the summer of 1663 the position as Lucasian Professor of
  Mathematics was created at Cambridge thanks to an endowment left
  by Henry Lucas. Barrow was an obvious choice for this position
  and he relinquished the Greek chair for the mathematics because,
  he explained, of his greater interest in mathematics than Greek,
  because less work was involved, and that it had always been his
  intention to hold the Greek chair temporarily.

(Henry Lucas was NOT the Edouard Lucas known in connection with the
Fibonacci sequence.)
