Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

On average, you cannot win at the game of blackjack without counting
cards. Try the following site:

   http://www.wizardofodds.com

Using computer simulations, people have developed the best possible
strategy that doesn't involve counting cards. With standard rules
(there are, of course, rule variations at different casinos), you are
at a slight disadvantage, something on the close order of 1% per bet.
So, following the basic strategy, you stand to lose roughly 1 penny
per dollar bet on average.

If you count cards (even as simply as keeping track of ratio of the
high cards to the low cards already out), you can make this a positive
expectation game. Again, through computer simulation, it has been
shown that if you use an effective counting strategy, you can get a
couple percentage points on the casino. 

The basic idea is that there is no game in the casino with a positive
expectation to the player. If you count, casinos tend to ask you to
leave. But if you play the basic strategy, you will gradually lose
money. Even with the best winning (counting) strategy, you will
fluctuate up and down because the best strategy is a long-term
strategy, not one that will guarantee results after a few hours.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
