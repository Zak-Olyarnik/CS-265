Hi Sunil,

To find the slope of the x-axis, we can pick any two points on it, and
use the definition of slope.  For example, (1,0) and (2,0) are on the
x-axis, and the slope between them is 

          change in y
  slope = -----------
          change in x

          0 - 0
        = -----
          2 - 1

        = 0

What happens if you try the same thing with two points on the y-axis?
