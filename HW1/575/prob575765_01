Hello Jeremy,

I substituted 0.1391+0.3807i into f(x) = x^3-3*cos(pi*x)+6e^x and found
f(0.1391+0.3807i) approximately equal to 1.4388+ 4.4364*i.  I can't understand why 
Maple thought it was a root.

I plotted and used Newton's method on the root near -1.4 and found the same result you 
did.  It's a perfectly good root.
