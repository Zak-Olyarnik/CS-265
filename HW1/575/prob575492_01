Sounds good to me, Heather!

If you really want a + bi form,
then instead of 0 you write 0 + 0i
and instead of i you write 0 + 1i
and instead of -i you write 0 + (-1)i
but that doesn't really matter -- you've solved the problem just fine.

Factoring cubics in general is hard -- we have a frequently
asked questions page entry on that topic -- but mostly we only
give questions in algebra 2 class that can be factored by some
sneaky method like the one you discovered here, grouping the
terms into pairs and finding a common factor.
