Hi Elizabeth,

The simplest thing to do is start generating lists of numbers.  The
numbers that meet the first criterion are

  8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33, ... (keep counting by 5's)

So whatever number we're looking for has to be in this list, which is
convenient, because it's basically 'all the numbers that end in 3 or 8'.  

The numbers that meet the second criterion are 

  10, 18, 26, 34, 42, ...  (keep counting by 8's)

If we think about this a little, we can see that this list will
_never_ have anything ending with a 3.  Do you see why?  So now we can
restrict ourselves to numbers that end in 8.  

Let's extend the list a little farther:

  10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98, ...

Do you see the cycle in the units digit?  

  10, 18, 26, 34, 42, 50, 58, 66, 74, 82, 90, 98, ...
   
   0,  8,  6,  4,  2,  0,  8,  6,  4,  2,  0,  8

The 8's repeat at predictable intervals - every time we add 40.  So we
can just crank those out directly:

  18, ..., 58, ... 98, ...  (keep counting by 40's)

So now you just need to find the first of these number that, when
divided by 9, leaves a remainder of 4.  

Does this help?
