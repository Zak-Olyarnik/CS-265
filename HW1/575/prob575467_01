If the solutions are a and b,
then the equation when factored would have to look like
(x - a)(x - b) = 0.
Multiply out the (x-a)(x-b) and you'll see why you get
x^2 - (sum)*x + product = 0.

Now, try the same thing for an equation with x^3, multiplying out
(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)
and you'll find even more interesting sum and product patterns!
