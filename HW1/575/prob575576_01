If this were for an algebra student, you could use variables. Let's
just use "blue" to stand for the number of blue pens. Then the number
of red pens is 3 times blue, and the number of green pens is 4 more
than that, or 3 times blue plus 4. Assuming those are the only colors,
the total number of pens is the sum:

  blue  = 1 * blue
  red   = 3 * blue
  green = 3 * blue + 4
  --------------------
  total = 7 * blue + 4 = 16

Taking away the 4, we are left with 12 pens which is equal to 7 times
the number of blue pens. That doesn't work out nicely, so it looks
like you copied some number or fact wrong. Can you check?
