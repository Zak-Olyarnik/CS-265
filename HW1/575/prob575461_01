I don't know why they would use "and" there, unless they were merely
saying that both equations have to be solved in order to find the
answers. Could you quote their exact wording?

The correct logical equivalent of

  |3x-4| = |x+11|

is

  3x-4 = x+11  OR  3x-4 = -(x+11)

because any x that makes EITHER equation true makes the absolute value
equation true.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
