I'm not quite sure what method you are trying to follow, since I
haven't tried reading all our answers to questions like this to see.
I'll recommend the rate approach. The number of eggs laid will be
proportional to the numbers of chickens and days, so we can talk about
a rate of "eggs per chicken-day" or "eggs per chicken per day". Our
rate is

         1.5 eggs            1
  ----------------------- = --- eggs/chicken-day = 2/3 egg/chicken-day
  1.5 chickens * 1.5 days   1.5

If you have 12 chickens and D days to lay E eggs, you will get

         E eggs
  --------------------
  12 chickens * D days

which has to be equal to the same rate. Write that as an equation and
solve for D.

If you need more help, please write back and show me how far you got.
