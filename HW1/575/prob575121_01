Below is a general note on permutations and combinations which 
should help to answer your question.


Permutations. nPr  or  P(n,r)
-----------------------------
If we have say 10 different objects (e.g. letters a - j of the 
alphabet) how many different 'words' could be made using 4 of the 
letters.  In this context we simply want 4 letters such as bghc, 
they do not need to spell a known English word.  But the ORDER of 
the letters does matter, so hgcb is different from bghc.

With 10 letters to choose from we can select the first letter in 10 
ways.  We are now down to 9 letters, so the second letter can be 
chosen in 9 ways, then the third letter in 8 ways and the 4th letter 
in 7 ways.

Total ways of arranging 4 letters chosen from 10 is 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 

                                                 = 5040  ways

We use the symbol  P(n,r) to represent the number of ways of 
arranging r things chosen from n different things, so here we have 
P(10,4) = 5040

We can also express P(10,4) using factorials.

Factorial notation uses the exclamation mark ! to show that it is a 
factorial, where for example 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

                   10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x ... x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800

You will notice that factorials get very big very quickly.

                              10!     10 x 9 x 8 x 7 x 6!
Using this notation  P(10,4)=----- = ------------------- = 5040
                              6!             6!

                                       n!
The general formula for  P(n,r) is   ------
                                      (n-r)!


Combinations  nCr  or  C(n,r)
------------------------------
These are closely allied to permutations except that the order does 
not matter.  For example in our problem of 4 letters chosen from 10 
letters the 4 letters  hgcb is the SAME combination as bghc.

To find the number of combinations we use the fact that the number 
of permutations of 4 letters from 10 is  P(10,4), but now EVERY 
permutation can be rearranged in 4! = 24 ways without giving rise to 
a different combination.   So the number P(10,4) is too large by a 
factor of 4! when we calculate the number of combinations.  This 
leads to the following formula for the number of combinations:

                    10!
        C(10,4) = -------  =  210
                   4! 6!

The general formula for the number of combinations of r things 
chosen from n different things is

                     n!
         C(n,r) = ---------
                   r!(n-r)!

To Summarize
-------------
If, as an example, you are selecting 4 people from a group of 10 to 
be chaiman, vice-chairman, treasurer and secretary then the ORDER of 
selection matters since the first person is the chairman and the 4th 
person is the secretary.   So in this case we use P(10,4) = 5040 as 
the number of ways of making the selection.

If you want to select a committee of 4 from 10 but with no 
difference 
in their individual status then the number of ways of making the 
selection is

   C(10,4) = 210

Here the ORDER of making the selection does not matter - i.e. the 4 
individuals A, B, C, D, could be chosen in any one of 4! = 24 
different ways but you still get the same committee of 4 persons. 


Example:  In how many ways can 6 numbers be chosen from 49 numbers. 
(The order you choose the numbers does not matter).

Here we use the combination formula and get:

                       49!
          C(49,6) = ---------  =  13,983,816
                      6! 43!   

Example 2:  If you have m X's and n Y's in how many DIFFERENT ways 
could these m+n letters be arranged.

In the case of m X's and n Y's  if all the X's were different and all
the Y's were different there would be m+n different letters to 
permute,
and this could be done in (m+n)! ways.  However since the X's are all
the same they could be permuted amongst themselves in m! ways and the
answer (m+n)! is too large by a factor of m!.  Similarly the Y's are 
all
the same and they could be permuted amongst themselves in n! ways
without giving rise to a new arrangement and (m+n)! is too large by a
further factor of n!.  So the actual number of different arrangements
is:

     (m+n)!
    --------
      m! n!

Example 3:  In how many different ways can the letters of the word
STEEPLES be arranged?

There are 8 letters.   3 E's  and 2 S'  and 3 other letters.

                             8!
Number of arrangements =  --------  =  3360
                            3! 2!
