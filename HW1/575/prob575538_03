>(1+R2)...(1+Rn)]^1/n}-1 ?

It would help a little, but the behavior of this sort of thing depends
on what number you choose (you chose 1 -- but why?  Is there a
reason you can be sure all your numbers are above -1?)

So I don't advise it in general, though there are circumstances where
this kind of "fudging" is reasonable to do.

Why don't you tell me a bit more about your data, and about why
you want the geometric mean instead of some other mean?  Then
maybe I can help out a little more.
