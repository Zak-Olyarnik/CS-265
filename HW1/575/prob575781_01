Hello Dave,

If the arch is the upper half of an ellipse, then I can give you a formula.  

The graph of the equation x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1 is an ellipse centered at the origin.  
The length of the horizontal cross-section (along the x-axis) is 2a and the length of the 
vertical cross-section (along the y-axis) is 2b.

You have 2a=7 and (I think) b=8/12. 

If you are comfortable with trig functions, a nice way to generate coordinates is to use the 
formulas

x=a*cos(t)
y=b*sin(t),

where, for your application, t would vary from 0 to pi or, in degrees, from 0 to 180 
degrees.
