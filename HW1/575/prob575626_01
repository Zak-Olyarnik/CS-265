This is more of a number theory problem than an algebra problem. 
Specifically, it can be solved using LCM (least common multiple). 
Think of it this way: The number of books is a multiple of 5, and it 
is also a multiple of 9. The central mathematical fact needed for 
this problem is that every number that is a multiple of two numbers 
is a multiple of the LCM of those numbers. If you need help in 
finding the LCM (it's really easy in this case), search the Dr. Math 
Archives for the phrase: least common multiple, using this page:
