Hi Janice,
The question of whether you're doing it right comes down to whether
"18 students take chorus" means that the chorus teacher has a class
of 18 students -- which is what I think, and probably what your
math teacher is expecting -- or whether it means in the list of students,
there are 18 who take ONLY chorus and NOT band -- which is what
you thought.

The total, 50 students, is certainly equal to
(students taking neither chorus nor band)
plus
(students taking ONLY chorus)
plus
(students taking ONLY band)
plus
(students taking chorus and band).

But I think that the students taking chorus and band are ALREADY
included in the 18 students taking chorus!  So the number of
students taking ONLY chorus would be 16, not 18.

How many students are taking ONLY band?

Once you have that, you can do
50 - (chorus and band) - (chorus only) - (band only) and you'll
have the number taking neither left over.

Does that make sense?

You can also search our archives here at Dr. Math for
  Venn diagram
and find some very useful solutions to problems that are
a lot like yours.
