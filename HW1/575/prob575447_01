Hi Ali,

The most general definition of a circle is the set of points that are
the same distance from a central point.  

An ideal (geometer's) compass would produce such a shape:  you stick
the point at the center, and use the pencil to mark the circle.  If
you assume that the distance from the point to the pencil doesn't
change, all the points drawn by the pencil are the same distance from
the center.  

There are equations you can use to specify the graph of a circle in a
coordinate plane, e.g., 

  (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

but this is just another way of capturing the same idea.  Note that
the distance between the points (x,y) and (h,k) is the square root of
the left hand side of the equation.  The right hand side is always the
same.  So if h and k remain constant, every (x,y) point that satisfies
the equation is the same distance from (h,k).

Does this make sense?
