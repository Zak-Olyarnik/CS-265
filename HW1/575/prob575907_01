I assume you mean, what four properties must a figure have in order to
be called a polygon; that is, you want a four-part definition.

I would say that a polygon is a simple closed curve composed of
finitely many line segments. You might break that down into these parts:

  1. Has a finite number of edges.
  2. Each edge is a straight line segment.
  3. Each edge joins the next one at its end.
  4. The edges form a complete loop that comes back to its
     starting point.

Could that be something like what you are looking for?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
