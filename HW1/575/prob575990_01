In fact, it doesn't matter which you do first.  There are really only
two rules that you have to follow:

  1) Don't divide by zero.

  2) If you do something to one side of an equation, you have
     to do the same thing to the other side. 

So I can look at 

  2t - 3t + 8 = 3t - 8

and decide to multiply everything by 58, or subtract pi from both
sides, or divide both sides by 1/2, and so on.  None of those things
will be particular _helpful_, but none of them are _wrong_.  The worst
that can happen is that I spend a little more time working towards the
solution than someone else might do.  

In general, when you see an opportunity to combine like terms, it's a
good idea to do it, simply because it reduces the number of terms that
you have to fool around with.  But you don't _have_ to do that.  For
instance, in this case, I might decide to combine the t terms on the
left, 

  (2 - 3)t + 8 = 3t - 8

        -t + 8 = 3t - 8

but I might not do that, because I don't really like negative
coefficients.  (Again, they're not wrong - I just don't like them.) 
So I might decide instead to add 3t to each side:

  2t - 3t + 8 + 3t = 3t - 8 + 3t

            2t + 8 = 3t - 8 + 3t

None of these moves is inherently 'right' or 'wrong'.  A lot of this
is just a matter of taste.  

In fact, one thing I might try is just subtracting one side of the
equation from both sides:

 (2t - 3t + 8) - (3t - 8) = (3t - 8) - (3t - 8)

 (2t - 3t + 8) - (3t - 8) = 0

That looks kind of startling, if you haven't seen it before, but it
has the value of getting everything over on one side, so I can stop
worrying about inverse operations!  Insteadm, I can just simplify:

 (2t - 3t + 8) - (3t - 8) = 0

     2t - 3t + 8 - 3t + 8 = 0         Note how I distributed the
                                      subtraction...

     2t - 3t - 3t + 8 + 8 = 0

                 -4t + 16 = 0

Does this make sense?

As I said above, it's not like there's one set of steps that you have
to follow.  If you get into the habit of thinking that there _is_,
you're going to experience a lot of frustration over the course of the
coming year.  

Do you play video games?  When you get into a new level, you don't
start thinking, "Uh, oh!  What are the steps I need to do, and in what
order?"  You start playing around, and trying things, right?  Some
things turn out to be helpful, and others don't, and you learn what
kinds of things to try from experience, rather than by memorizing some
strategies that someone else tells you. 

Algebra works _exactly_ the same way.  The way you learn to solve
equations like this is to jump in, follow the two rules above (which
can really be reduced to a single rule:  "You can write down anything
that's true."), and see where they take you.

'Combining' them how, exactly?

I'll be happy to help you, but you need to help me first.  The way we
generally play the game of 'algebra' is that we start with a
statement, like

    2t - 3t + 8 = 3t - 8

and then we make equivalent changes to both sides; or we simplify
something on one side.  At each step, even if we don't write an
explanation for what we do, we need to know that we could justify it
if someone asked us to.  The result is a new statement:  

 (2t - 3t + 8) - (3t - 8) = 0        

     2t - 3t + 8 - 3t + 8 = 0         

     2t - 3t - 3t + 8 + 8 = 0

                 -4t + 16 = 0

In fact, what this chain of statements is saying is:

   Assume that statement 1 is true. 
  
   If statement 1 is true, then statement 2 is true.

   If statement 2 is true, then statement 3 is true.

   If statement 3 is true, then statement 4 is true.

    .
    .

   If statement (N-1) is true, then statement N is true.

   statement N

So even though we often talk about 'combining' terms, or 'getting rid
of' terms, or 'moving' terms, what we're really doing is constructing
a chain of statements, where the truth of each one is guaranteed
because we made some truth-preserving transformation to the statement
before it (i.e., we did the same thing to both sides, or simplified
one side in a legal way).  

And if we do this without making mistakes, what it tells us is that

  If statement 1 is true, then statement N is true.

And if statement 1 looks like

    2t - 3t + 8 = 3t - 8
  
and statement N looks like 

    t = 4

then we've 'solved' the equation.  But all we've really done is
rewrite our original statement in a way that makes it look less
complicated.  This might be a good time for you to take a look at
the following item from our archive:

  I solved it.  Now what?
  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/65308.html

Don't feel bad if this is the first time you're hearing this stuff.
For some reason, it's rarely covered in algebra classes - even though
it escapes me how anyone can make sense of algebra without
understanding it. 

Anyway, can you try showing me what you did, by writing it as a series
of statements like this, where each one follows from the one before it
because of some legal change?
