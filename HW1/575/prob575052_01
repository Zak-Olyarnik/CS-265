The real comparison should be the percentage of drunk drivers and 
percentage of sober drivers who have accidents.  The percentage of 
ACCIDENTS is not relevant.  You could have just one drunk driver in 
10 million drivers.  His contribution to the total percentage of 
accidents would be negligible even if he had an accident every time 
he took to the road.
