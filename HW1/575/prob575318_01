Hi Hsiao,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  When you have a group of numbers like
yours (more than two), then it is generally confusing to say "they are
relatively prime," so a mathematician usually says either "their gcd
is 1," meaning that there is no number bigger than 1 that divides ALL
of the numbers AT THE SAME TIME, or he says that they are "pairwise
relatively prime," meaning that there is no number bigger than 1 that
divides at least TWO of the numbers.  It may be that the teacher meant
pairwise relatively prime and didn't express that clearly, but only
the teacher can tell you what s/he was thinking, so you might consider
asking the teacher.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
