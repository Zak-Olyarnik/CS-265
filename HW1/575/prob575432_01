Hi Sherry,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  The backwards E is called a
"quantifier" and should be read "there exists."  For example, you
might see

  Ex,x^2=y

(where the E is backwards) which means "there exists an x such that
x^2 = y," in other words, y is a square.  Sometimes they will specify
a set, as in "there exists an x in the set Z (or Q or R or any other
set) such that...."  The "in the set" or "is an element of" is a small
epsilon (like a small curvy E, or a small backwards 3).

The line through it almost always means "not" whatever the symbol
means without the line.  So a backwards E with a line through it means
"there does not exist."  (If you meant a forward E with a line, then I
don't know - give me the context in which you found it.)

The long c (or sideways U) means "is a subset of."  Some people use
this to mean "is a proper subset of" (but not the whole set) and use
the same symbol with a line under it to mean "is a subset of" (or
equals the whole set) in the spirit of "less than" and "less than or
equal to" symbols.  Others use the sideways U to mean "is a subset of"
(or equals the whole set) and might use a line under it with a slash
through the line to mean "but not equal to the set" or they might say
"does not equal" (equals sign with a slash) separately.  Less common
is the "contains" symbol, which is just a backward c or "is a subset
of" symbol and means the same as the subset symbol when you switch the
two sets.  (Just like "less than" being the same as "greater than"
when you switch the two numbers.)

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
