I don't care for vague questions like this, though perhaps if we were
in the classroom and knew just what had been discussed we would have a
better idea what is intended here! My guess is that they (what age?)
are  learning tricks for learning addition facts, and have been told
that the "doubles" are easy to learn; so they would know 6+6=12. Then
if you want to find 6+8, you can start at 6+6 and add 2 since (in
algebraic notation) 6+8 = 6+(6+2) = (6+6)+2 = 12+2 = 14. So my answer
would be something like "6+8 is 2 more than 6+6". See if that rings a
bell when you suggest it!

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
