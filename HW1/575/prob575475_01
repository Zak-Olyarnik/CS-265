Hi Rah,

>1.What is the probability that you roll a 2 or a 3 with an ordinary 
>six-sided die?

The basic idea is that 

                the number of ways [something] can happen
  probability = -----------------------------------------
                the number of ways anything can happen

For example, if we flip a coin, two things can happen: we get heads,
or we get tails.  If we ask:  What is the probability of getting
heads, we have


                the number of ways to get heads
  probability = -----------------------------------------
                the number of ways to get heads or tails

                1
              = -
                2

So the probability is 1/2.  Let's extend this to a die.  There are 6
possible outcomes if we roll a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.  If we ask:
What is the probability of rolling a 2, we have

                the number of ways to roll a 2
  probability = -----------------------------------------
                the number of ways to roll anything

                1
              = -
                6

so the probability is 1/6.  What if we ask:  What is the probability
of rolling a 2 OR a 3?   Now there are two ways to get a 2 or 3, so we
have

                the number of ways to roll a 2 or 3
  probability = -----------------------------------------
                the number of ways to roll anything

                2
              = -
                6

                1
              = -
                3

Does this make sense? 

>2. A bar graph shows weights in kilograms for a group of althletes.

For a line plot, you start with the bar graph, 
     _
     _     _
     _   _ _
   _ _ _ _ _
   _ _ _ _ _
   _________

you put a dot at the top of each bar, 

     .
     _     .
     _   . _
   . _ . _ _
   _ _ _ _ _
   _________

then you remove the bars, 

     .
           .
         .  
   .   .    
   
   _________

and then you draw a line connecting each dot to the one next to it. 

A circle graph, or pie chart, is a little more work:

Does this help?
