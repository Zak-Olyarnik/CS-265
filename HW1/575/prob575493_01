Hi Ginny,
Draw a piece of a circle and label the ends A and B.
Label the center of the circle P.

What the question is saying, I think, is that the length of the
STRAIGHT line from A to B (not the curved arc) is 40 inches.
Is that what they mean by "width"?  I think so.  So draw that
straight line, and label it 40.

Then, from P, draw a line perpendicular to AB.  I think that "arc height"
means the length of this segment from P to the middle of AB, 10 inches.  
But maybe by "arc height" they mean the length of the other piece of the 
line, from the middle of AB out to the circle?  Hm.

Well, in either case, you know that PA = the radius.
You know that the distance AB = 40, so if the middle of AB is M
(where that perpendicular line hits it), then AM = 20.

Depending on what they mean by "arc height", the length
PM might be 10, but I think they want the length from M to the
circle to be 10, so the length PM = (radius - 10 inches).  Does
that make sense?

Once you have those labeled, PM, AM, and PA, you have
a right triangle, so you can use the Pythagorean theorem to
solve.

Let me know how it goes, and write back if you still have questions!

Enjoy,
