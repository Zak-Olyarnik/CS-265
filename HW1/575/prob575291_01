You are correct in being unsure of your answer.

The question can be restated as

  7 is _____% of 0.7

When we take a percentage of something, we multiply the number by 
that many hundredths:

  7 = ___/100 * 0.7

You can use algebra to solve this:

  7 = x/100 * 0.7
  7/0.7 * 100 = x

Or you can note that 7 is the part, 0.7 is the whole, and the 
percentage is the part over the whole, times 100%.
