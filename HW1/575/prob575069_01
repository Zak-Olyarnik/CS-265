Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

If the base is rational (i.e. base 2, base 4, etc.) the number will be
irrational in all bases. Proving it is relatively simple.

If a number is rational in some base, it can be expressed as a/b,
where b is not 0. Converting a and b to other bases doesn't not change
the numbers. It only changes how they "look". So, the number is still
a/b and rational. So, it is not possible for a number to be rational
in one base and irrational in another. Hence, an irrational number is
irrational in all bases.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
