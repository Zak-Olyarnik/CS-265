Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The mistake is assuming v = d/t. That is only true if the acceleration
is constant and exactly equal to 0. It is no longer true if there is
any acceleration. In other words, uniform motion only exists if there
is no acceleration. The average velocity, given a uniform
acceleration, is given by v = 2d/t. 

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
