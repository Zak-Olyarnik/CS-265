Hi, Kindra --

Try always following four steps to solve word problems:

(1) carefully define the variable(s) and expression(s) you are going 
to use
(2) write an equation, using those variables and expressions, to 
write an equation reflecting the given information
(3) solve the equation
(4) answer the problem (the solution to the equation is usually not 
the whole answer to the problem)

Let's use this process on your problem.

(1) We need to find the length and width of the rectangle, so we can 
start with

  let l = length
  let w = width

In this problem, we can simplify this, because we are told that the 
length is twice the width.  So we can get by with a single variable:

  let width = w
  then length = 2w

(2) Now use your formula

  P=2w+2l

and the information given in the problem (that the perimeter is 60) 
to write an equation, using the expressions from (1) for the width 
and length:

  perimeter = twice width plus twice length = 60

  2w + 2(2w) = 60

Now we can solve the equation for "w" (step 3) and use our result to 
answer the question.

(3) solve the equation

  2w + 2(2w) = 60
  2w + 4w = 60
  6w = 60
  w = 10

(4) answer the question

  the width is w=10
  the length is 2w=20

I hope this detailed example helps.  Please write back if you have 
any further questions about the process in general or this problem 
in particular.
