This was correct:

  12x - 6 + 9x + 12 = 2 - 8x

To simplify the left side, you have to combine like terms; you may
have just added wrong:

  12x + 9x - 6 + 12

  21x      + 6

The right side can't be simplified; it almost looks like you read it
as (2-8)x, but it is not! Now you should have

  21x + 6 = 2 - 8x

Next, you want to add 8x to both sides so that x is only on the left;
and subtract 6 from both sides so the constant is only on the right.
You seem to be attempting the right thing, so let's see if you can
finish on your own. And can you see what mistake you made that led to
the wrong equation?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
