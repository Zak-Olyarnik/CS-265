That's good math there, but I would like to mention that you only need
that x+2 or x-2 is DIVISIBLE by 11.  So you should also check x=2, but
this gives y=0 and that's too small.  And you should check that if x-2
or x+2 is 22 or 33 or something bigger, than x is too big.

Well, B&C is easier than A&C.  For B&C, you should make things easier
for yourself by multiplying both sides by 2, giving

  2*11*y = z^2 + 7z,

which you can solve just like the last one by factoring,

  2*11*y = z(z+7).

So at least one of z and z+7 must be divisible by 11.  (And at least
one must be even, not necessarily the same one that is divisible by
11, but that happens for every z so we don't care.)  So what values
for z does that give?

For A&B&C, you only have two points of intersection for A&B, so you
just have to check whether either of those is in C.

Finally, for A&C, you have

  2x^2 = z^2 + 7z + 8,

or

  17 = (2z + 7)^2 - 2(2x)^2,

which is a Pell equation when written in the form

  17 = A^2 - 2*B^2,

and these are generally solved in two steps, sometimes using continued
fractions, and sometimes not.  The most important thing is that
*every* solution to

  17 = A^2 - 2*B^2

has

  A + B*sqrt(2) = +/- (c +/- d*sqrt(2)) * (r + s*sqrt(2))^n

where

  17 = c^2 - 2*d^2

is the SMALLEST positive solution, which is c=5, d=2, and

  1 = r^2 - 2*s^2

is the SMALLEST positive solution, which is r=3, s=2, and n is any
integer (negative, positive, or zero).  So you have four different
solutions for every n.

There is much more to be learned about Pell equations, but you only
need the smallest couple of solutions, so you can find those and be done.
