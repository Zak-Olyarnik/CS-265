Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

Consider the parity of x, y, and z. In other words, if the sum x+y is
even, then both x and y are even, or they are both odd. The same is
true for y and z. Therefore, either all of x, y, and z are even, or
they are all odd.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
