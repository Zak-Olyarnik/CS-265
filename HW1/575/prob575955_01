It sounds like you may have a grid with letters marking locations in
one direction and numbers in the other, so that you can identify any
point on the grid by a pair like A,2 or C,5, where the line for the
letter and the line for the number meet. Then those "minus greater
than" combinations may just be arrows:

  A,2 --> C,5 --> and so on

would mean start at point A,2, draw a line to C,5, then continue to
the next point, and so on. Does that sound right?

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
