Hi Rahul,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You let a variable like

  a

represent the rightmost digit, and you let a variable like

  b

represent all of the other digits, so that your original number is

  10*b + a.

Then if the new digit is c, then the new number is

  100*b + 10*c + a,

which is equal to

  9 * (10*b + a) = 100*b + 10*c + a.

Simplify this, and show that a has to be divisible by 5.  So what are
the choices for a?  What happens in the first case?  What happens in
the second?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
