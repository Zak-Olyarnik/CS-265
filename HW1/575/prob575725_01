Hi Steve,

That's a good start.  Think back now to when you first learned about
division.  Note that all three of the following facts,

   12 / 3 = 4

   12 / 4 = 3

       12 = 3 * 4

are just different ways of saying exactly the same thing.  That is, if
you see one form, you can replace it with either of the others.  

You're in the same situation:

    1 / x = (1 11/12)

    |   |      | 

   12 / 3 =    4

So can you see how to switch to a different form where x is by itself? 

Try that, and let me know what you get.
