Hi Kelly,
one nice method that might help is that if
(x^3 + y^3) = (stuff) * (other stuff),
then you can notice that when x = -y, the left side is zero.
Therefore one of the factors on the right side must also be 0,
and so you can figure that (stuff) could be (x+y) -- the right side
has to be divisible by x+y.  Does that make sense?

Then, once you know that, you can do some long division.
 
                x^2   -   x y   + y^2
       /-------------------------------
x + y / x^3 + 0 x^2 y + 0 x y^2 + y^3
        x^3 +   x^2 y
       --------------
              - x^2 y + 0 x y^2
              - x^2 y -   x y^2
             --------------------
                          x y^2 + y^3
                          x y^2 + y^3
                         --------------
                                  0

Does that make sense?

You can do the same thing with (x^3 - y^3) necessarily being
divisible by x-y and then from there you find the quotient by
long division again.

Let me know if you have more questions!
I'm always in favor of people understanding things rather than
only memorizing them.  The sum and difference of cubes are things
I did NOT have memorized when I was a student, and it didn't slow
me down much -- I have them memorized now, just because I
teach them at least once per year...
