The "best" answer is the correct one: that there is no unique answer --
it depends on which set of nine years are considered.

The "most likely answer" is 365x9 + 2.

Or another true answer is: "Approximately 365x9".

And there's actually a third exact possibility: 365x9 + 1.

That's because certain leap-years are omitted to make the calendar
match the fact that the period of revolution of the earth is 365.26
days, so every hundred years, roughly, a leap year has to be
omitted.  1900 was such a year, so if you start in 1897 through
1905, for example, only 1904 is a leap-year.
