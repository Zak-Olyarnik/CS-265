Hi Katie,

What makes primes interesting is that any composite number can be
decomposed into a unique product of primes.  For example, 

  12 = 2 * 2 * 3

There is no other way to get 12 by multiplying any other set of
primes; and no other number decomposes into this set of primes. 

Now, suppose we allow 1 to be a prime.  Then we lose this feature:

  12 = 2 * 2 * 3

     = 1 * 2 * 2 * 3

     = 1 * 1 * 2 * 2 * 3

and so on. 

So we don't include 1 in the definition of 'prime'. 

Does this make sense?
