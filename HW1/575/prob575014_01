Hi,

Suppose I write a number on a piece of paper, and seal it in an
envelope.  I then tell you:

  5 times the sum of the number in the envelope and 7, is 30.

Your job is to figure out what the number is. 

The sentence is somewhat awkwardly worded.  We can make it a little
clearer:

  If I add 7 to the number in the envelope, and multiply the
  sum by 5, the result is 30.

For what number would that work?
