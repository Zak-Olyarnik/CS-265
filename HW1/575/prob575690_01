Hi Lizzy,

You multiply.  The idea is that if we just put two quantities next to
each other, there's an implied multiplication.  This allows us to
write things like
 
    2 4 3
  3x y z

without a bunch of multiplication symbols.  It's true for numbers as
well as variables; but if we just stick numbers together, like 

  562

we lose track of which digits belong to which number:

  562 = 5 * 62?

      = 56 * 2

      = 5 * 6 * 2?

For this reason, we use parentheses to disambiguate:

  5(62) = (5)62 = (5)(62) = 5 * 62

Does this help?
