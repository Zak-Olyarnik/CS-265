Hello Millie,

What are you supposed to do with this expression (not an equation, apparently)?  Simplify 
it?  

I'll assume that you mean 

3x^2/( (2+x)(3+2x) ) *  9x^5/( 4(3+2x))

If so, you should find

(27*x^7)/(4*(2 + x)*(3 + 2*x)^2)

The 3 and 9 can be multiplied; the x^2 and the x^5 can be multiplied to obtain x^7; the 4 
stays in the denominator; the (2+x) just goes along with the 4; the (3+2x) and (3+2x) can 
be multiplied.
