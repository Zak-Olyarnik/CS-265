Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

I believe the left hand side should be 2(x+3). If the expression were
2x +3, most authors would write "the sum of 2 times a number and 3".
Since the word "sum" comes after "times", most mathematicians would
consider the multiplication to apply to the sum.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
