Hi again Gunnar,

First, notice that the intersection of I and J is {0}, because, for 
any element x in that intersection, we have:

  0 = x - x = 0 + 0

and the expression of 0 is unique by hypothesis.

Now, you can write, for i in I:

  i(a+b) = ia + ib = i

i is in I, and so is ia, because a is in I and I is a left ideal. 
This implies that ib is in I; however, as b is in J, ib is also in J.

Can you continue from here ? Please write again if you require 
further assistance.
