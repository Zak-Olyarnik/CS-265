Hi, Sam --

This seems like quite a challenging problem for a 12-year-old....

Here are my suggestions for solving it.

(1) If you take the two digits in a 2-digit number, what are the 
largest and smallest differences there can be between the two digits?

(2) With the largest and smallest possible differences from question 
(1), how many different differences are possible?

(3) This last step is the hardest.  Let me describe a similar 
example.  Suppose I have 4 different pairs of good shoes I can wear 
to work.  In four days, I can wear each pair once; but in 5 days I 
have to wear at least one pair twice.  In 12 days, I can wear each 
pair 3 times; but in 13 days, I have to wear at least one pair 4 
times.  And so on.  See if you can use your answer to question (2) 
above and apply this type of reasoning to your problem.

I hope this much helps.  Please write back if you still have 
questions about this.
