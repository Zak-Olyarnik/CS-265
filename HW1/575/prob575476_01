Hi Ian,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Unfortunately, you're missing several
right parentheses, so I can't tell which terms belong to which functions.

That said, I assume that you mean you want to solve this for D as a
function of G.  Unless you can combine the arccos and the arcsin into
a single function (which is probably not likely), then you cannot
"solve" this for D.  So you will need to calculate D from a given G
using Newton's method or iteration, or some other numerical method.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
