Hi again,

This is essentially a matter of definitions.

The first remark I would have is that, strictly speaking, your f does 
not qualify as a ring homomorphism, if we use the fact that R and S 
have a multiplicative identity. Indeed, a homomorphism between unit 
rings must send 1_R to 1_S. See, for example:

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RingHomomorphism.html

(last paragraph).

However, we never used the fact that R and S have a 1, and this is 
irrelevant to this example.

This other point is that f^(-1)(0) = Z, and the question is whether 
or not Z itself qualifies as a prime ideal (note that my proof did 
not address that point - there was no check that I is a proper 
ideal). I agree that most authors require a prime ideal to be proper; 
however, there is no universal agreement on that point. See, for 
example:

  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeIdeal.html

(see the remark at the end of the third paragraph).

This question has some interesting aspects.

The full ring satisifies the basic property of prime ideals : if it 
contains the product of two elements, it contains at least one of the 
elements (both statements are always true). However, we do not 
consider the element 1 as a prime, and the full ring is the principal 
ideal <1>, so it can make some sense not to consider it as a prime 
ideal. But again, we do not consider 0 as a prime element, but 
everybody agrees that the 0 ideal is prime in an integral domain. As 
you see, there are arguments in either direction.

If we require a prime ideal to be proper, the statement would be true 
if we add the condition that J does not contain f(R).

Now, if we insist on considering R and S as unit rings, and f to be a 
homomorphism between unit rings, then f(1_R) = 1_S, and, in this 
case, if I = R,  J contains 1_S and is therefore equal to S, which 
means that J is not prime according to the current definition.

To summarize, to make the statement true, we must:

* Remove the condition that R and S are unit rings (or, more
  accurately, remove the implied condition on f).

* Accept that the definition of a prime ideal implies that the ideal
  is proper.

* Add the condition that J does not contain f(R).
