Hi Hoba,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  Since sup(B) is the LEAST upper bound
of B, any smaller number, such as sup(A) in this case, cannot be an
upper bound for B.

What conclusions can you draw from this statement?

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
