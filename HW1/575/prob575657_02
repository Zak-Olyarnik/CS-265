This page may help with the rules:

In elementary math, sometimes the wording of questions is odd because
they are trying to avoid more sophisticated concepts that are needed
in order to say what they really want. If they said to round to the
place containing the zero, they mean to round to the ten-millions, and
you should have zeros in the millions and lower places; so your second
guess would be right. If the wording was a little different, it might
mean something different -- the wording you used ("round the zero") is
unclear to me.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
