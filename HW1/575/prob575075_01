Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

The probability that you get exactly r successes (i.e. heads) out of n
trials is given by:

    P(r success|n trials) = C(n,r) * p^r * (1-p)^(n-r)

Since we want the probability of _at least_ one heads, we can
calculate that probability as:

   1 - P(0 heads|n trials) = 1 - C(n,0) * p^0 * (1-p)^(n-0)
                           = 1 - (1-p)^n

We want this probability to be 1/2, or:

                       1/2 = 1 - (1-p)^n

Given p, you simply need to solve for n.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
