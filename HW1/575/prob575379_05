Hi again Gunnar,

I'm sorry, but I misread your question as "r = s". If "~" 
means "associate of", then the statement is true.

If r divides s, we have s = rt for some t. As s is prime, s divides r 
or t. Note that both r and t divide s.

If s | r, we have:

  r = su
  s = sut
  ut = 1

(since we are in an integral domain). The last statement shows that t 
is a unit, and therefore s and r are associate.

On the other hand, if s divides t, we can show in the same way that r 
is a unit, and this contradicts the definition of a prime.
