Hello Jeremy,

I said, "I plotted [the function f(x) = x^3 - 3cos(pi*x) + 6e^x]  and used Newton's method 
on the root near -1.4 and found the same result you did [I found -1.37911].  It's a 
perfectly good root."

x=-1.37911 is a root of the equation f(x)=0.

Did your try evaluating f(-1.379109571703653) to see if it is essentially 0?  I know very 
little about Maple, but, surely, there's a way of finding this root in Maple.

No, I don't know any free online programs for calculating roots.  I calculated the root with 
Newton's method on my HP48GX and found the same answer as above.
