Military time works just the same as regular time, except that you 
don't write the colon between hours and minutes, and hours can go up 
to 23. So you add the minutes, then convert to hours and minutes, 
and "carry" the hours. In an example like yours, let's add 45 
mintues to 1325:

    1325
  +   45
  ------
      70

Now, 70 minutes is 1 hour and 10 minutes, so we write down 10 for 
the minutes, and add 1 to the hours:

     1
    1325
  +   45
  ------
    1410

Essentially what we did was to see that 70 is more than 60, so it's 
not legal as a number of minutes; we subtracted 60 to get it in 
range, and added 1 hour to make up for dropping 60 minutes.

For a problem like your second example, follow this:

     1
    1325
  +  435
  ------
    1800

Here 25+35 = 60, which changes exactly to 1 hour and 00 minutes, so 
I wrote down 00 minutes and carried the 1.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
