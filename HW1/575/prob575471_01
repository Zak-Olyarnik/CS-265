There's not enough information there to solve -- the blanks
could be any number!

I would really hope that there's some information in the bottom
line (the result of the subtraction) that you can use to figure out 
what's going on with those top blanks.

OK, now we are talking!  But if you check, you'll see that
it doesn't quite work out.  You need to take into account where
borrowing might happen.  Once you see the 1 - 5 = 6 at the end,
you know you had to borrow a unit from the next decimal
place over, so the 2 - 5 there will equal 6, not 7.  There are
a few other similar mistakes in other columns, where your
digits are off by 1 because you need to take the borrowing
into account.

Does that help?
