Hello Archana Jha,

a/(6+a) is the rational number.  Next,

(a+3)/(6+a-3) = 1.

The last equation is

a+3 = a+3,

which is satisifed for all a.  We cannot take a =-6 because that would make the 
denominator 0.  The answer is: all rational numbers like  a/(6+a).  Let a=7, for example.  
Then 7/13  has the property that (7+3)/(13-3) = 10/10 = 1.
