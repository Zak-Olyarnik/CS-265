Hello Jeff,

Suppose the triangle you seek is called ABC, and you know the length
of AB, the length of the altitude from base BC to A (call this x),
and the circumradius (call this R).

Draw AB, and draw a circle of radius x about A.  You know that the line
BC has to be tangent to the circle you just drew, since the altitude is
perpendicular to the base, and all possible base points are represented
on that circle.

Now, can you find the center of the circumcircle?

Is that enough of a hint?
