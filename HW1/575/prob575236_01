Joyce:
Welcome to the exciting world of mathematics.

Lets look at adding without decimals and see what happens.
First, write the problem vertically (up and down). It will be easier 
to see.

   22

   255
   689
   799
 +_____ 
  1743

So, we just write down the ones digits and then carry the tens digits 
to the next place.

Lets do the same thing with decimals.

   2 2

   2.55
   6.89
   7.99
 +_____ 
  17.43

They both look the same except for the decimals. So, write your 
problems vertically, line up your decimals, add just like you do in a 
regular addition problem and you will come up with the correct 
answer. 

If you need further assistance with this matter, please feel free to 
contact me again. Come back to see us soon.
