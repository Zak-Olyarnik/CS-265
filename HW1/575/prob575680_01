Hi Chestina,

I think you're talking about the property of 'density'.

In a discrete ordered set, like the integers, you can't always find
another integer between two integers.  For example, there is no
integer between 4 and 5.  

In a dense ordered set, like the real numbers, you CAN always find
another real between two reals.  We can even make up a formula for
doing it:  Add them, and divide the sum by two.  

Does this help?
