Hi Kerry,

There is no '0' in Roman numerals, so you could just use

  XXVII VIII V

which would save a couple of characters.  No one else is going to
understand what this means, so the difference between MMV and V is
negligible, so long as the two of you understand what it means. 

For what it's worth, if you want to save space, you could note that
August 27 is 4 days short of September, the 9th month, so you could do
this:

 IX-IV, V          9 [months] - 4 [days], [200]5

That would be a nice little code for the two of you, and it would be a
great conversation starter.  :^D

Does this help?
