You can't find the angles at B or D, but you can find the angle BYD.

How are you at algebra? That's how I did it. I let angle ABY = a and 
angle ADY = b, and the angle we want is angle DYB = c. Using what you 
know about quadrilaterals, you can write two equations, and you'll 
find that you can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate 
both a and b.

We can work out another way to think about it if you can't do this.
