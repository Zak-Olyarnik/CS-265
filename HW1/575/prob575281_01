Hi Abby,

Incorrect.  There are three modes: 1, 4, and 6. 

>In a set of data having 3 or more modes, would the answer asking for

It's possible for a data set to have any number of modes, up to the
number of values.  (For example, in a data set where no value appears
more than once, _every_ value is a mode.)

The first and third answers are correct.  The only way to have no mode
is to have no values. 

Does this help?
