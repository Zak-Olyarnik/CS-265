Hello Angela,

I won't try to tackle the question of "How do you get a child over a mental block with 
math?"  I will describe one of the ways of subtracting with borrowing.

514  means 5 one hundreds, 1 ten, and 4 units.  Because the 9 is larger than the four, we 
rearrange the 514 this way:

514 is 5 one hundreds, 0 tens, and 14 units.  This is done on paper by putting a small 1 
up and the the left of the 4 and changing the 1 originally in the second place to a 0 
(usually we put a diagonal line through the 1 and write a small 0 above the "cancelled" 1).

OK, we can subtract 9 from 14, giving 5.  Now we have 0 on the top and 9 below.  Another 
problem!  We do the same thing.  Instead of 50 (just thinking about the two digits on the 
left), which is 5 hundeds and 0 tens, we write it as 4 hundeds and 10 tens.  We run a 
diagonal line through the 5 and write a 4 above; we put a small 1 near the 0, making is 10.  

Now we can subtract 9 from 10.  Finally, 4 -2 = 2.

It's much the same in all other subtraction problems.
