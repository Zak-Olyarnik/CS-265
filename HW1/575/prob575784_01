Hi Christina,

The definition depends on the context.  For example, if we're just
discussing something like place values in integers, then we would use
'powers of 10' to mean 10 raised to any non-negative integer exponent,
i.e., 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, and so on.

When we start talking about place values in decimal expansions, we
expand the definition to include negative integers: 

  ..., 10^-3, 10^-2, 10^-1, 10^0, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, ...

In the absence of any particular context, it would be surprising for
someone to use 'powers of 10' to include negative exponents.  But
'surprising' isn't the same as 'incorrect'. 

Does this help?
