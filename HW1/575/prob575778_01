No.  The distance moved is the circumference of the outer tire.  But
while the outer tire simply rolls, the inner tire is dragged along as
it rolls.  

To see this, imagine that you simply take the inner circle out and
place it next to the outer one, then roll them both.  After a full
revolution, the outer circle has moved farther.  To get the inner one
lined up again, you'd have to slide it over without rotating it. 

Looking at it this way, we've separated what happens to the inner
circle into two different transformations: rolling and sliding.  When
you keep the centers of the circles coincident, the two motions are
combined, which makes the sliding part harder to visualize. 

Does this make sense?
