Hi Ash -

Just a quick follow up to Dr. Schwa's answer.  Your approach should
work fine - you are just making a calculation mistake.  If A = 48 and
B = 35, those two together add to 83 degrees, and C is therefore 180 -
83, which is 97 degrees, the same result you got using the Law of
Cosines.  You just forgot to subtract the 83 from the 180.

As for your question as to why the largest angle should be done first
using the Law of Cosines, the answer is that it doesn't _have_ to be,
but it makes the most sense to do that one first.  

As Dr. Schwa talked about, the Law of Cosines will return the one
correct value for the angle, whether it's obtuse (greater than 90) or
acute (less than 90), whereas the Law of Sines can be ambiguous and
might lead to two possible angles, one acute and one obtuse.  

Since the biggest angle in the triangle is the only one that _might_
be obtuse (can you see why?), solving for that one first using the Law
of Cosines removes any possible ambiguity when you then solve for one
of the other two angles by using the Law of Sines.  We know that the
two that aren't the biggest must be acute, so we can just take that
answer from the Law of Sines.

Does that make sense and help?
