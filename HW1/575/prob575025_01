Thanks for writing to Ask Dr. Math, Viky!

1) is true.  2) is false.

Proof of 1) can be had from the definition of a domain.  Since R is
a domain, there do not exist in R nonzero elements x and y with
x*y = 0.  If such do not exist in R, how can they exist in R', a
subset of R?

A counterexample to 2) can be constructed from R = R' x R', the
Cartesian product.  Then if a is nonzero in R', (a,0)*(0,a) = (0,0).

Feel free to reply if I can help further with this question.
