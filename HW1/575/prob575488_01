Hi Kristine,

You are doing exactly the right sort of thing, by looking at small
examples.

You're absolutely correct about your idea for three consective integers.

Here's how you might prove it:  If the first number is x, then the next
two will be (x+1) and (x+2), so the sum will be:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x + 3.

The same idea can be used for any particular number of consecutive
integers.  For example, the sum of any four, beginning with x will
be 4x + 6.  Here's why:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) = 4x + 6.

But I assume that what you'd like is a formula in terms of x and y for:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (y-1) + y,

where y is bigger than x.

Let me give you a hint.  See if you can work out the answer with this
hint, and if not, write back to Doctor Math.

Here's the hint:  Suppose I want to add:

7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13

I don't know the answer yet, so let me call it S:

S = 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13

But if I add the numbers in the reverse order, I obtain the same answer:

S = 13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7

Let me add the last two equations, term by term:

S+S = 2S = (7+13) + (8+12) + (9+11) + (10+10) + (11+9) + (12+8) + (13+7)

2S = 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 7x20 = 140

Since 2S = 140, S = 140/2 = 70.

Does that help?
