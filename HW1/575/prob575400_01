Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

It depends on your assumptions.

The source is irrelevant if you accept the 2% estimate. In other
words, the only case the source is important is if you suspect the 2%
estimate is not accurate. If it is accurate (and if you have no reason
to believe otherwise), then by considering the source of the statistic
and not accepting calculations based on it, you are essentially
trusting your "gut" and ignoring probability theory altogether. In
this case, using numbers is rather unnecessary, since you trust your
instincts more than the actual numbers. There's no theoretical basis
for examining the source of the statistic unless there is some
uncertainty about the source (in which case, there is an additional
probability associated with the source).

Assuming that the 2% estimate is accurate and that it is independent
from day to day (i.e. instead of 50-day chunks, there is just a plain
2% chance each day), then they two scenarios provide equivalent
probabilities.

I hope this helps.
