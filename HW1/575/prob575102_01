Hi Wallace,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.  We usually write exponents with "^",
so "r squared plus 1" would be written r^2 + 1 .

To determine if f is injective, ask whether it is possible to find
two different numbers r and s such that f(r) = f(s).  Is that 
possible?

To determine if f is surjective (not subjective), you need to 
determine whether the equation

   r^2 + 1 = y

can always be solved, for any value of y.  Can you determine whether
this is true?

If you have any questions or need more help, please 
write back and show me what you have been able to do, 
and I will try to offer further suggestions.
