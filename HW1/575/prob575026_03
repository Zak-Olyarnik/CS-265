Hi Viky,

I am glad that you didn't simply immediately accept the fact that -1
is a number in any ring and is clearly a unit.  It does need showing,
but it can be shown.  You see, a ring is a group under +, with
identity 0, which means that the unit 1 (which you were told is in the
ring) has an additive inverse.  Let's call that number -1.  Now we know

  1 + -1 = 0

as well as the normal rules of rings (like distributivity).  We also
know that

  1 * 1 = 1

by the properties of 1.  Now what does

  (1 + -1) * (1 + -1)

equal?  Why?  That gives you an equation, which will be useful.  Now
use the distributive law on this product, and simplify to show that

  -1 * -1

is the additive inverse of -1, which is what?  That means -1 is a
unit.  But there is only one unit, which is what?  So -1 must be the
same thing as that.  Then look back at the first equation

  1 + -1 = 0.

Does this help?  Can you finish it now?
