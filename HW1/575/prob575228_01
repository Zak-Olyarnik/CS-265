Hi Grant,

Note that you can't really 'get y alone' unless it's part of an
equation, e.g., 

  16y = something

In that case, your intuition is correct: if you divide both sides of
the equation by 16, 

  16y   something
  --- = ---------
  16       16

        something
    y = ---------
           16

you do end up with y by itself on one side. 
    
Does this help?
