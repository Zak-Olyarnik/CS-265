Hi Chris,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  You certainly could just list all of
the numbers in all three sets.  But that's not to say that you can't
solve the equations.  Which is easier might depend on you.

The equation you would need to solve is

  a_x = b_y

where x and y are integers (in fact, positive integers no bigger than
15 and 20, respectively).  That gives you A&B.  And so on.  For A&B&C,
take the solutions you found for one of the other intersections (which
will already be few) and see which of those are contained in the third
set.

If you want some help solving an equation in two variables where the
two variables have to be integers, then I would recommend searching
our archives for "modular arithmetic" and "Diophantine equations" if
you aren't already familiar with those two concepts.  For more help on
these particular equations, write back (after doing the search).

This technique will also give you all of the solutions in the
intersections even if they were infinite sets generated by those
sequences, rather than stopping at 225, 224, and 229.  Writing out all
of the numbers wouldn't work in that case, though it will work for
your finite sets.
