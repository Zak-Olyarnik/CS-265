Hi, Chris --

The answer to this problem will seem obvious after you see it; and 
after working a few problems like this, you won't have any trouble 
with similar problems.  But it is hard for many students to see the 
simple answer at first.

If the smaller number is 2 and the sum of the two numbers is 10, 
what is the larger number?  What did you do with the "2" and "10" to 
find the other number?

If the smaller number is 3 and the sum of the two numbers is 10, 
what is the larger number?  What did you do with the "3" and "10" to 
find the other number?

If the smaller number is 1.894 and the sum of the two numbers is 10, 
what is the larger number?  What did you do with the "3" and "10" to 
find the other number?

If the smaller number is pi (3.14159.....) and the sum of the two 
numbers is 10, what is the larger number?  What did you do with 
the "pi" and "10" to find the other number?

And now, to answer your question...

If the smaller number is "x" and the sum of the two numbers is 10, 
what is the larger number?  What do you have to do with the "x" 
and "10" to find the other number?

I hope this much helps.  Please write back if you have any further 
questions about any of this.
