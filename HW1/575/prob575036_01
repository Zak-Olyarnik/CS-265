Hi Kim,

The simple answer would be a 'trillion-gon', since that naming scheme
works for anything.  For example, a 'pentagon' can also be called a
'five-gon', although people would look at you weird for using that
name.  But a polygon with N sides is an 'N-gon', so it's hard to argue
 with the logic. 

Does this help?
