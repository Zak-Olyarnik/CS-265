Hi Dahvyd,

We have an article on that subject in our archive:

  http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/62500.html

You will notice that there are two proofs in the article. Your idea 
is quite similar to the first proof (which is rather complicated). 
However, in the case of straight lines (or, more generally, of lines 
that divide the area into two regions), the second proof is much 
simpler and makes a direct use of induction.


Does this help?  Write back if you'd like to talk about this 
some more, or if you have any other questions.
