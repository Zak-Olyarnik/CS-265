Hi Igor.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  This appears to be some 
sort of contest problem, so we're not able to help you until after
the contest is over.

For the time being, though, I can say that the solution is readily
understood by an elementary school student--so you're working too
hard with concepts such as pi(n).
