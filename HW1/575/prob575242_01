Taylor
Welcome to the exciting world of mathematics.
An exponent tells you how many times to multiply the number times 
itself. 
examples: a^2 = a x a
          a^3 = a x a x a
          a^4 = a x a x a x a  (and so on)

A negative exponent tells you to do the same as a positive exponent 
except you need to use the reciprocal.
examples: a^-2 = 1/a x 1/a
          a^-3 = 1/a x 1/a x 1/a
          a^-4 = 1/a x 1/a x 1/a x 1/a  (and so on).

So, your problem has a negative exponent and will could be written as

  (4/5 x 4/5)^ -1 or simply reciprocate it and then square it:

  5/4 x 5/4 

I will let you finish the problem.
