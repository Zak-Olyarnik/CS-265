Hi Matt,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  It seems to me that you know what the
function is but just want a clever way to write it.  A mathematician
would usually write it as something like this:

           0  if n = 1 or 2 mod 4
  f(n) = {
           1  if n = 0 or 3 mod 4

If you are unfamiliar with modular arithmetic, it only means that the
remainder when you divide n by 4 is 0, 1, 2, or 3.  So you could also
write this as:

           0  if n = 4k+1 or n = 4k+2 for some integer k
  f(n) = {
           1  if n = 4k or n = 4k+3 for some integer k

On the other hand, if you really want to do the (-1)^n thing, then you
can write f(n) as

  f(n) = (1/2)(1 + (-1)^(n(n+1)/2)).

That looks confusing.  Let's write it as

                    n(n+1)/2
          1  +  (-1)
  f(n) = --------------------
                 2

Then if n is 0 or 3 mod 4, then either n or n+1 is divisible by 4, so
that the exponent will be even, and you will get (1+1)/2.  If n is 1
or 2 mod 4, then one of n and n+1 will be odd and the other will be
even but not a multiple of 4, so the exponent will be odd, and you
will get (1-1)/2.

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
