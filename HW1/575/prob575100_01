Here are 52 "dots", of which 15 look like  "*":

  ***************ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

What fraction does this represent? You have 15 out of 52 parts, which
is the fraction 15/52.

Now you want to express this as a percentage. A percentage is just a
fraction in a special form: "per cent" means "out of 100" (think
"cent" as in "century"), so a percentage is a fraction whose
denominator is 100. That is, for example, 15 percent, or 15%, means
the fraction 15/100.

So you want a fraction of that form that is EQUAL to the fraction 15/52:

  x/100 = 15/52

Can you see what to do next?
