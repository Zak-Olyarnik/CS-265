You are correct to begin the solution of this equation by simplifying 
both sides of the equation. You haven't finished simplifying the left 
side, but you are well on the way.

On the right side, think of how you would evaluate the expression if 
you knew the value of x. First you would add 2 to x (evaluating the 
expression in the innermost parentheses). Then you would multiply 
that value by -4. Thus, you'll be evaluating the expression -4(x+2) 
at an early stage.

Instead of evaluating it, you can simplify it:

  -4(x+2) = -4x + -4*2
          = -4x - 8

Now you've got

  2(5-4(x+2)) = 2(5 + (-4x - 8))

The next step will be to simplify the expression in the outer 
parentheses:

  (5 + (-4x - 8)) = ?

Continue in this manner.
