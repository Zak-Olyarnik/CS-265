So far, so good: the union of D and E is all whole numbers,
and the intersection is the same as E.  (do whole numbers include 0?
Does set E include 0?).

Similarly the union of D and F is all whole numbers,
and the intersection of D and F is the same as F.

But what about the union of E and F?  The intersection?
Seems like you didn't get answers for those two questions.
