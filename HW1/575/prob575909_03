In an expression, each 'term' is something that gets added to (or
subtracted from) the other terms.  For example, in 

  xy + yz - x/z

we can delimit the multiplications and divisions with ()'s, and that
will show us the term boundaries:

  (xy) + (yz) - (x/z)
  \__/   \__/   \___/
   term  term   term

Does this make sense?  Try answering your question now, and let me
know what you get...
