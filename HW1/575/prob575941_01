Check our FAQ on Primes for links to at least one discussion of this
question (look near the bottom):

  Prime numbers
  http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.prime.num.html

Briefly, we define "prime" so that the most important theorem about
them is as useful as possible. We want to be able to say that any
natural number can be written in exactly one way (ignoring order) as a
product of primes. If 1 were a prime, we couldn't say it that simply,
since any number could be written in many ways, such as 5, 5*1, 5*1*1,
and so on.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
