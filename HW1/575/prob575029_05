Hi again,

As I told you in my previous reply, you may say that, if I is an 
ideal of R, then f(I) is an ideal of f(R). (In fact, this forces f to 
be surjective, when considered as a homomorphism from R to f(R)).

For the second statement, the fact that f(I) is an ideal of f(R) 
results from my comments on the first statement. We need to prove 
that f(R) contains an element not in f(I).

To exhibit such an element, we use the fact that I is a proper ideal 
of R, i.e., R contains an element x not in I, and we show that f(x) 
is not in f(I) - this will show that f(I) is a proper ideal of f(R).

To show that f(x) is not in f(I) we assume, by contradiction, that
f(x) is in f(I). By the definition of f(I), this means that there is 
an element of I, say x', such that f(x) = f(x'). As f is a 
homomorphism, this means that f(x-x') = 0, or that x-x' is in ker f.

As we assumed that I contains ker f, this means that x - x' is in I; 
as x' is in I, this means that x is also in I, contradicting the 
choice of x.

A correct version of the second statement would then start as "If I 
is a proper ideal of R containing ker f...". Note that 0 is usually 
considered a proper ideal; if you want to exclude that case, the 
condition becomes that ker f be a proper subset of I.

For the last claim, that f^(-1)J is prime if J is prime, I still do 
not see how it could be false - I may be missing something obvious. I 
will leave your question open so that other Math Doctors can have a 
look at it.
