Hi Attae,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

A shape with 4 sides is called a "quadralateral".

There are more than 4 shapes that have 4 sides.  You can find 
examples of some of them here:

  Quadrilateral Formulas   
  http://www.mathforum.com/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.quad.html

Don't worry about all the equations, just read the list of shapes and 
the English sentences describing them.

Hope this helps.  If you have other questions or you'd like to talk 
about this some more, please write back.
