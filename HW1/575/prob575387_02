Hi Meital,

Thanks for writing to Dr Math.  Start from

  a*m + b*n = 1

and use this to show that there is a number which is 0 mod n and 1 mod
m.  Also show that there is another number which is 1 mod n and 0 mod
m.  What happens if you multiple these by a and b?  What happens if
you add them together?

If you have any questions about this or need more help, please write
back and show me what you have been able to do, and I will try to
offer further suggestions.
