Hi Sue,

In science, (we assume that) there is a set of rules (the fundamental
laws of nature) in operation, and the task is to figure out what the
rules are by observing the results that occur when the rules are
followed. Basically, it's an attempt to reverse-engineer the machinery
of the universe.  

In math, it's the other way around - we get to choose the rules, and 
the task is to discover the results of choosing any particular set of 
rules. 

There is a superficial similarity, which leads some people to confuse 
the two pursuits. In science, the way you test a theory is to codify 
it as a set of rules, and then explore the consequences of those rules 
- in effect, to predict what would happen if those rules were true.   
You do the same thing in math - and in fact, the way it's done in math 
serves as a model for the way it's done in science.  

But here is the big difference: In science, as soon as your 
predictions conflict with experimental data, you're done. You know 
that your rules are wrong, and you need to start putting together a 
new set. 

In math, this kind of conflict can't arise, because there is no 
necessary connection between any mathematical theory and the world.  
The way you 'test' a set of rules in math is see whether the results 
they produce are interesting enough to induce mathematicians to keep 
playing with them. 

We might summarize the situation this way: Science is the pursuit of 
_the_ correct description of _this_ particular world; whereas math is 
the pursuit of interesting descriptions of possible worlds. Whereas 
scientific theories are right or wrong, mathematical 'theories' are 
merely interesting or uninteresting. 

I hope this helps.  Write back if you'd like to talk about this some 
more, or if you have any other questions.
