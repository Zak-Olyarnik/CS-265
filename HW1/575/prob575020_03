I think this is meant to say something like "The time is 1338; 
later, after working 2 hours and 22 minutes, what time is it?". If 
so, then my second example was just like it:

    1338
  +  222
  ------

Add 38+22 minutes to get 60 minutes, which is 1 hour; so you write 
down 00 minutes and carry 1 hour.
