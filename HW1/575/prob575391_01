Hi Per,

That would actually give you the probability of _not_ being killed.

You're right - adding the probabilities for enough years would give
you a probability of greater than 100%, meaning that if you live long
enough, you _must_ be hit by lightning!

You can't really 'assume a lifetime of 75 years', since that means you
don't start considering the probability of getting killed by lightning
until the 76th year.  I think what you mean to ask is this:  

  What is the probability of going 75 years without getting
  killed by lightning?  

Then you can subtract that from 1 (or 100%) to get the probability of
getting killed by lightning before making it to age 75.  

To compute the probability of _not_ getting killed, you raise the
probability for one year to the 75th power, which comes to about 

  (1 - 3.2 x 10^-5)^75 = 0.9976

which means you have about a 99.8% chance of not getting killed.  So
you have about a 0.2% chance of getting killed. 

Does this help?
