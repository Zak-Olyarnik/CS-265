Hi William,

That is, in fact, the way they do it (although they would divide by
366 in leap years).  

>3.5% pa net divided by 365 = 0.009 per day
>yet when i apply this formula i get different figures to my bank

Okay, first you don't want to round it off to one significant digit. 
A better approximation would be 

  3.5/365 = 0.009589

Second, note that this is 3.5 _percent_, so for each compounding
period, you want to multiply by 1.00009589, not 1.009589. 
 
Note that 

  1.00009589^365 = 1.0356

so compounding every day for a year would be the same as compounding
3.56% once at the end of the year.  

Does this help?
