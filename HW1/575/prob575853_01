Hi Shannon,

Let's try both, and see if either seems helpful:

  1) Add -6 to both sides:

            -6 + 6z = 0

       -6 + 6z + -6 = 0

           -12 + 6z = 0

  2) Subtract +6 from each side.  Actually, subtracting +6 
     is the same as adding -6.  (Do you see why?)  So this
     gives the same result.

So neither of those strategies seems helpful.  Since adding a negative
number to both sides didn't help, why not try adding a positive number
to both sides, and see whether that gets you closer to a solution?
