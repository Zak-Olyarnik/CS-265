Hi Ehab,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math. To show that sup(B) = inf(A), it is
enough to show that sup(B) <= inf(A) and sup(B) >= inf(A). 


Every element b in B is a lower bound for A.  What does this tell 
you about the relationship between b and inf(A)?  What can you 
conclude about sup(B) and inf(A)?

Also, note that inf(A) is an element of B, since inf(A) is a lower 
bound for A.  What does this tell you about sup(B) and inf(A)?

If you have any questions or need more help, please write back and
show me what you have done, and I will try to offer further 
suggestions.
