Hi Daniel,

A polynomial of degree 0 is a constant, non-zero, polynomial.

The important property of the degree (and what makes it useful) is 
that:

  deg(fg) = deg(f) + deg(g)

for any two non-zero polynomials f and g. If you define the degree of 
the zero polynomial as 0 (while keeping the property above), then 
taking, for example, f = 0, we get:

  deg(fg) = 0 = 0 + deg(g)

and this implies that the degree of any polynomial (like g) must be 0.

Note that, by your agrument, you could also write 0 = 0*x^k for any 
k...

Some authors define the degree of 0 as minus infinity, but this is 
only a matter of convention.

Does this help?  Write back if you'd like to talk about this 
some more, or if you have any other questions.
