Hi, Aretha and Brian.

You did the math right. If you charge them 17 cents per square foot 
that comes out to $2,276.30.

One way you could figure out a good rate would be to pick the amount 
of money you want to make each night and divide that by the number of 
squre feet. Does that make sense? Write back if you want to talk 
about this more or if you have any other math-related questions.
