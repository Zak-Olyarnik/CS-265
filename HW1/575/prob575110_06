You can assume that it's (x+y)^2, but that won't work, since
x^3 + y^3 is NOT the same as (x+y)^3.

So the question is, how do you factor out (x+y) from (x^3 + y^3)?
It's just like asking how to factor some big number like 2001.
Well, first you factor out a 3 ... that's an obvious divisor ... but
what do you have left?  You can't assume, you have to divide
to find out that it's 667.  Then you can go on factoring 667.

Similarly, if you divide x^3 + y^3 by x+y, you get x^2 - xy + y^2.
Then you could try to factor that further, but you'll get rather
nasty things -- no nice integer coefficients -- so usually you stop there,
just as you stop factoring 14 = 2*7 and don't write 14 = 2 * sqrt(7) * sqrt(7)
usually.

Does that answer your question?
