Hi Jen.

thanks for writing to the Math Forum.  This is an internet math
problem that Google used to pre-screen job applicants.

I'll give you a hint:  Do you recognize the string of digits in f(1)?
If you do, then you have a huge headstart on the problem.  If you
don't, then I don't think there's any reasonable way you could be
expected to solve it.
