Yes, it's true. If you don't have such a theorem in your text, it's 
easy enough to prove. Just consider the two right triangles formed 
by the two parts of the chord, the segment, and two radii, and show 
that they are congruent. Or use the fact that the center of the 
circle is on the perpendicular bisector of any chord, so the latter 
must coincide with the given segment.

If you have any further questions, feel free to write back.
