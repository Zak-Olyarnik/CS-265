Hi,

Thanks for writing to Dr. Math.

"Imaginary" does not mean the same in mathematics as it does in
everyday speech. It is perhaps better to call them complex numbers.
They exist and are well defined. So, 10/0 is simply undefined. It is
not a real number, nor an imaginary number.

Does this help?  Please feel free to write back with any questions you
may have.
