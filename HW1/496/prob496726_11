Hello, Munawar.

I have been patient, hoping that you would be able to communicate 
more clearly about your ideas if I asked enough questions to help you 
see what needs to be explained. But you have not done so. None of 
what you say here makes any sense to me, and you have made no attempt 
to define the basic terms you are using. I am going to have to 
terminate this discussion, since there is no hope of making progress 
due to the language problem and your unwillingness to define terms. 
To continue would waste your time and mine.
