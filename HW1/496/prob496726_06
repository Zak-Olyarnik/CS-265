Hi, Munawar.

We discussed some of these ideas before, and I don't think you have 
answered the questions I asked then. I will have to repeat some of 
what I said before, and ask you again to clarify.

First, you talk about "numerology". If you really mean that, it has 
nothing to do with mathematics, and is not a true science. All I can 
talk about is the mathematical facts and terms.

This is a list of numerals, or symbols for numbers. There is a base-
ten numeral system (commonly called a number system) that uses these 
ten digits to name every possible number. I can't see in what you 
write why it makes a difference to you whether they are called 
numbers or numerals.

>i can not found the numeral or number zero in this system.

The symbol "0" is the numeral zero. Why do you not see it?

>I see the zero nothing, But zero nothing not a number or numeral.
>Zero nothing mean, this is not  a zero. In Arabic language gsifir 
lah.
>this is a system digit,(No value).

You have never explained what you mean by "zero nothing" and whatever 
other kind of zero you have in mind. If you want to talk about a 
distinction, please define it, rather than just using a phrase with 
no meaning.

In mathematics, there is only one quantity called zero, and only one 
symbol "0", although certainly there are different uses (as a digit 
in writing numbers, and as a number used in algebra, for example). 
When we use digits to write a number, each digit is multiplied by the 
value of its place, and therefore is used also as a (symbol for a) 
number. For example, the numeral "123" represents the number 1*100 + 
2*10 + 3*1; the numeral "101" represents "1*100 + 0*10 + 1*1", and 
the "0" means zero tens. Each digit is a symbol for a number.

I still can't tell whether, by "numerology", you are talking about a 
sort of magical interpretation of numbers (which is what the word 
means in English), or just "the study of numbers and numerals" in 
some more or less mathematical sense. From your references to God, I 
suspect you do mean the former, and not mathematics.

"Physics" is probably not what you mean; that is the science of 
physical objects and their motions. Numeral systems can be considered 
to be either mathematics or linguistics (a way of writing about 
numbers), but not physics.

There are many ways you can USE numbers, both in science (as in these 
examples) and in any other field. But those are not part of 
mathematics itself.

Just writing a list of symbols does not tell me what you mean by 
them. The first list APPEARS to be intended as a list of the ten 
symbols we use to write numerals; I don't know why you say their 
value is changeable, since they have definite meanings. The second 
list appears to be just part of a list of whole numbers, which 
continues with 11, 12, 13, and so on. That is an entirely different 
thing.

There are ten digits; but there are far more than eleven numbers, and 
numbers are not symbols at all! If there are two "symbols" for zero, 
what are they? I only see one symbol, which is "0". The number 10 is 
not a symbol, and is not a zero.

None of this makes any sense to me. From what I know of the 
development of the Arabic number system, ever since the place-value 
system was discovered (borrowed from India) the number ten has always 
been represented by two digits, namely "10"; that is what the place 
value system means. See this page for that history:

  http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Arabic_numerals.html

Perhaps you can tell me what "old Arabic" system you are referring 
to -- what is the date of its use, and what symbols did it use, and 
did it use place value?

I am not interested in your philosophy, but in the actual use of 
numerals. If that is what you are asking about, please tell me 
whatever you can about that -- why you think there are two numerals 
for zero, and what they are and how they are used -- and I can 
discuss that.
