Hi, Munawar.

Your English makes it very hard to follow your thinking. I happen to 
know someone who speaks Urdu; perhaps you could write (briefly) in 
your own language, and I could ask him to help me figure out what you 
are saying. It might be easiest for him if you could give your own 
translation into English, so he would only have to correct it rather 
than write a whole new translation.

But I can attempt to answer the parts I do understand.

You have not answered my question at all. What do you mean by "zero 
nothing", and in what sense is there no zero in the list you wrote, 
which includes "0"??

What do you mean by "polarity"? What makes 1 through 5 have negative 
"polarity"? Who says this, and why? We can't talk about this without 
a definition.

Can you refer me to some site about Arabic numerals that mentions 
these two zeros? Everything I read shows only one symbol called zero 
(sifir).

And what do you mean by "wheel numerals and permanent magnet map 
numerals"? Again, either define them clearly or give me a site that 
defines them.

I think you are referring to angles measured in degrees here, but I 
can't tell what you are saying. What do you mean by "1-", by 
"0, 45o-", and so on?

What do you mean by "coding system"? What do you mean by "physics"? 
What do vectors have to do with a numeral system?

I think you are claiming to know what primitive "cave men" used for 
numbers, that they used only hash marks like "|||" for three. But 
there was no way of writing zero in the early period; I have never 
heard of "stone age" markings including a zero.

What do you mean by "gun" and "bolt"? I think, correcting your 
spelling, you meant this:

  So that we say as an example, zero nothing is a gun, and all the
  numerals are bullets.
  Ten times we fire the gun, but one time the firing misses. So, in
  this number or numeral system, we lose the bullet ten or number
  zero. 
  I cannot find the bullet number ten in this number or numeral
  system. I mean this.

But I still have no idea what you are saying. What is "zero nothing", 
in what sense is it like a gun, why should "bullet ten" be considered 
to be the number zero?

What do you mean by "the structure of one and zero"?

If you can't give me definitions or references for the terms and 
ideas you refer to, I will have to stop responding to you; without 
clear communication, it is not worth the effort.
