The number of possible outcomes is given by the coefficient of x^4 
in the expansion of

    (1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4)^6

This gives the term 126x^4 so there are 126 possible combinations of 
4 numbers.

Alternatively

You can model this as distributing 4 balls into 6 boxes.  See 
diagram below

   | *  |   | **  |   | *  |   |   This represents 1,3,3,5
     1    2    3    4   5    6

The total number of possibilities is the total number of ways we can 
arrange 4 *'s and 5 |'s.  That is 9 objects, 4 of which are alike of 
one kind and 5 alike of a second kind.

                              9!
  Number of arrangements = -------  = C(9,4) = 126   (as before).
                            4! 5!

What each of these 126 products would be will require a computer 
program and I'm afraid I cannot help you there.
