I used egrep for all of the questions in part 1
Q1.1: egrep 'the' bright_side_of_life
Q1.2: egrep '\<the\>' bright_side_of_life
Q1.3: egrep '\<Just\>'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.4: egrep '\<[jJ]ust\>'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.5: egrep '^\<[jJ]ust\>'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.6: egrep '\<[bm]ad\>'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.7: egrep '\<[db]r*eath\>'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.8: egrep '\<you\>[.,]?$'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.9: egrep '^\s'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.10: egrep '^$'  bright_side_of_life
Q1.11: if the question is asking how many empty lines there are, then 
egrep '^$'  bright_side_of_life | wc -l
produces 10.  (The line in the
/* KS badly */

/* 4.10.11 *
header is actually made up of spaces, as examined in the VI editor)



Q3.1: I ended up using git checkout l3, but I believe the instructions you
give are incorrect.  I tried twice to follow step 4, deleting the answers
and committing my change, but then trying to checkout after that tells me
that the file l3 does not exist.  My understanding is that committing is an
action that cannot be undone, so if we want to checkout a deleted file, we
must do so before committing the delete.
Q3.2: The git log command will display a list of recent changes.
